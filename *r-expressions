/^.*$/ is just a list, and could be ,[,"^",".*","$"] or ,[,"^.*$"] or ETC

"(())" nesting would be easy to say (EG) /(\(←.*\)→){2}/
"()()" wouldn't work though

balancing acts can be handled by (EG)...
/:balance(,"\w(",")","(.*)")/ where "(.*)" is a groupie
/:balance(,LHS,RHS,MIDDLE)/ where :balance() is a placeholder for some"-thing" else syntactically, or not

r-expressions should be made turing complete; then Shyamscript could be implemented in r-expressions!!! :D
