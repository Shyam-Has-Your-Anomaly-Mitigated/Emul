Is it possible to DOS the server by recursive SSHing? I remember the first time I gained access to the RMIT servers; one of the first "-thing"s I did was SSH between my accounts on all three of them...I felt so 1337 ∵ I was proxying just like in the black hat games, but I this time I had ¿infinite? "nodes"; I was untracæble!!! :D
