`orgasm`
* assemble to the ℂomplex computer
  1. optimisation will be done here
  * process c̄ the ℂomplex computer
  * cross-assemble to ℝeal computers
    * process c̄ the ℝeal computer
* interpret c̄ the ℂomplex computer
* REPL c̄ the ℂomplex computer
* 100% configurable c̄ transpiler; this works similar to cross-assembling

need to find the files with my notes; that was a long time ago...
