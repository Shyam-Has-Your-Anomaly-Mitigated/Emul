# Orgasm Runs ₲on Arnold Schwarzenegger Machine

need to study instruction sets, and virtual machines:
* [ASIP, CISC, RISC, EDGE (TRIPS), VLIW (EPIC), MISC, OISC, NISC, ZISC, Comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:CPU_technologies)

`orgasm`:
* assemble to the ℂomplex computer
  1. optimisation will be done here
  * process c̄ the ℂomplex computer
  * cross-assemble (self-optimising) to ℝeal computers
    * process c̄ the ℝeal computer
* interpret c̄ the ℂomplex computer
* REPL c̄ the ℂomplex computer
* 100% configurable c̄ transpiler; this works similar to cross-assembling

need to find the files with my notes; that was a long time ago... (I think it's on my 16TB...)
<br>some"-thing" about `.dna` (probably configuration) & `.cum` (probably language) files, and stuff... (pretty sure there were more file types...)

lets face it, the ℂomplexity will probably just be lists...

## Arnold Schwarzenegger Machine
*this is the ℂomplex computer; yes it's `asm`...*
