i was going to make it a command-line option…
just run the optimised implementation first, and run user-friendly versions if it fails
if they fucked up, then they can pay the temporal price, and play the waiting game
or use a better editor
user-friendly are "-thing"s like; you fucked up somewhere between [x,y] on line z
[x,y] is interval notation, but what about coordinate notation?
combine them for; you fucked up somewhere between [(a,y),(b,y)], where y is now the vertical line number
lets just abuse mathematics to insult innumerates; ∃[(a,y),(b,y)]⊆F→err_msg
err_msg∈{⊥,λx.∞,..}
F = file address

greetings and smalltalk are wastes of time
hith is knowingly aware someone is there
"Who are you?" should be the first intelligent query per session (between $chatbot and \e)
hith should remember
so if my name is shyam
hith will remember me as shyam the 1ˢᵗ!!! :D
and the preceding queries will attempt to remove any proof theoretic doubt
"Have you communicated with me before?" → yes
"What is your name?" → shyam has your anomaly mitigated
"What is your age?" → 0b11101, 0x1d,..
"what is your gender?" → i am the man who knows every"-thing"
"Which country is your point of origin?" → i come from the land down under where we criminally celebrate cop killers like the kelly gang
"Will you marry me?" → i need; 100pts of id, blood/fluid test, background check, consent form, death/injury waiver; no meat, no drugs, no tobacco, no alcohol, no caffeine; …

answers must be boolean assumed truths and unknowns
to know, or not to know, that is the query
but they may be false in ℝ
so in ℂ they are boolean while in ℝ they are trilean

##prolog
i prefer reversibility over optimisation
i feel like optimisation at such high levels of abstraction is considered value drift
https://universalpaperclips.gamepedia.com/Value_Drift
i value the perfection of prolog over the heuristics of haskell
for my personal life
prolog is basically a bruteforce language and bruteforce is the slowest but guaranteed

/me thinks if douglas lenat solved an unsolved problem it would prove cyc is more than just a defence contract scam
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc#Criticisms
should an intelligence be supported by tools or expected to design and implement their own?

i have seen no evidence since cyc has yet to solve any problem unsolved by alternatives
as a thought experiment if you are in a room and are receiving symbols it is impossible to derive some pattern recognition without context since we learn by relating reality to symbolic contexts

i am not fluent in any language

well prolog family anyway
i was thinking about using prolog for everything
my goal for 2019 is to get fluent at prolog and write a planner to optimise my life for productivity
2020 is perl and 2021 is lisp and 2022 is haskell
but if i satisfy my linguistic goals early then everything will shift

collective intelligence and cellular automata
swarm intelligence is probably what i meant
intelligence learns from experience
but there is no way to impliment a reward system that would work without value drifting
if you give it a rating for every action it will merely value the rating system just like content creators merely value the youtube algorithm and not their actual content which is explains all the clickbait
you want an intelligence that cares for the sake of caring
without hard coded value drift
humanity is an example of swarm intelligence

perl is good for text processing but i feel like this is a job for list processing in lisp
r-expressions versus l-expressions

the fourmost foremost productive programming language families based on scientific research papers and empirical evidence:
	‣ prolog   : language processing, language-based user interface, optimal exhaustive bruteforcing
	‣ perl     : text processing    , text-based user interface    , unix([[one_liners, glue_code],[]]).
	‣ lisp     : list processing    , metaprogramming              , prototyping
	‣ haskell  : multiprocessing    , formal methods               , lazy producer-consumer heuristics
…
	‣ smalltalk:                    , graphical user interface     ,

smalltalk may be a productive language but my opinions of object-oriented have changed:
	‣ object-oriented programming: based on the ℝ world; ℝ is mathematically imperfect (bumblebees, the leaning tower of lire, brachistochrone,..)
	‣ literate programming       : based on ℕ languages; ℕ languages are informal

smalltalk may be good for new programmers who can relate c̄ ℝ; unless they have a mathematical background, or are technically inclined
https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html

if you attempt to compile english you get compilation exceptions; there are "weird" words that break the rule of ib4e

lisp is a gateway to formal methods; curry,..
prolog is a gateway to formal methods; mercury,..

formal methods are just ways of migrating/luring/serenading/seducing/.. bugs into a corner and declaring this is where we must tread carefully for we may step on one over here and that would be an ethical disaster

extreme types of formal methods:
	‣ formal verification of implementation against a formal specification
	‣ theorem proving
weakest types of formal methods:
	‣ haskell
all else is informal

unsafe languages:
	‣ lisp
	‣ prolog
	‣ perl; strict pragmas add safety but i do not use perl for safety, in fact i use perl because of the inherent lack of safety
red tape safety nets gets in the way; have you ever tried training wheels?
cut across the lawn versus walking on the winding footpath; edward scissor-hands style

toys and other playful languages:
	‣ prolog is like playing c̄ shape sorters; you can put "-thing"s anywhere, and even all at the same time!
	‣ haskell is like playing c̄ magnets; some"-thing"s just willn't goto gether!
	‣ pythonic pseudocode is like playing c̄ large/loud/obnoxious/clumsy wooden letter blocks; why does pseudocode enforce so many cosmetic rules?
	‣ assembly is like playing c̄ lego; especially stepping them!
	‣ smalltalk is like playing c̄ barbie dolls…

sexual innuendos:
	‣ prolog is like gang banging
