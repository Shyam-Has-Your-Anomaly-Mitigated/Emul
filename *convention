this official boxing convention is only a guide; ℝeal boxers box how they want to (it's optiomal (optimal+optional); for problem solving is unique to the problem solver)

	tabs for indentation; width=3…
	spaces only after the first character after indentation

	Shyamscript/hmm/games/psychic:
		2 or more consecutive spaces = ASCII art (character-based bit-map)
		tabular data = use appropriate data formats (DSV/CSV/TSV/ETC) & rendering warez; ℝeal programmers don't maintain spacial tabulation by hand!
		indentation (/\n/ to a /./; s/to a/between/) = configurable tabs (one per indentation depth/level/ETC)

		programming tools process each character; they could optimise, by tabbing spacial indentation, but you shouldn't treat it faithfully (like a religion)

		use format strings, or more complex generative hacks, for consecutively strung spaces

8≪ when typing/writing about shyamscripts; use " ,namespace ", " :namespace() ", " :namespace ", ETC ... punctuation in natural language is usually followed by a space
8≪ but the official boxing convention is...
, a, b, c, d, e: f(): g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s

, [
  , a
  , b
  , c
]
8≪ these are frowned upon...
