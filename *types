there's sort of like a ¿bidirectional? type hierarchy; kind of like class inheritance in OOP
look; every"-thing" is just the same, okay!
that's just the way I want it to be
don't complain to me that I can't, nor shouldn't, be attempting to mix up my types; just make it work
tools should be more intelligent, and act like I'm their project manager
	first day at new job
	given task
	start working on task
	project manager peers over my shoulder
	project manager says not to worry about best practices, and to just get the job done by the deadline, and make sure it works
	by the deadline your program doesn't even compile, but you hand it in anyway
	project manager says to grab your "-thing"s and get out
	project manager (working ass off) calls security (sits on ass all day)
	you're confused
	if you're ℝeally lucky... (everyone's probably ℝeally lucky; for the sake of the waiver) 
		project manager says you look good/nice/ETC, or feels sorry for you, or is just happens to be in the mood, or not busy, or ETC (has the time for a newbie)
		project manager says you're not the first
		project manager says they need mind readers; "-thing"s will be said c̄ implications, and if you don't understand some"-thing", or have any problems, then you should be ℝeally querious (communicative)
		project managers don't have the time for hand-holding (pair programming solves this to help newbies survive, but backfires when project managers double down on the workload if they're thinking multiplicatively)
		project managers manage multiple unrelated projects (just imagine how much work their higher ups have to manage; it's additive between all of the project managers who manage multiple teams each working on unrelated projects!)
		you can't even read your little programs, and understand them; try attempting to understand the entire project before a meeting
		project manager says it's not like uni where you can hand in some"-thing" that doesn't work, and still get graded
		project manager says your "-thing" is a puzzle piece, and if it doesn't fit/work, then it's garbage
		project manager mentions how many people walk in through those doors, and how many walk out
		project managers start at the top recruits, and work their way through until they find ℝeal psychics
	you ask/beg/ETC for a second chance
	project manager says to sign a severance-package waiver
	you sign it
	project manager fires you for free
	the waiver didn't mention a second chance
	project managers need you to pay attention; attentively read their minds
	verbal agreement?
		"sign it, and I'll give you a second chance"
		you failed your second chance by not reading the contract before signing it; that was your second chance (verbal agreement, nor contract, mentioned any (tempoℝæl/ETC) terms of second chance)
		contractual obligations fulfilled
		security should be arriving any moment now...
	decision:
		a) you leave c̄ whatever's left of your pride/dignity/ETC...
		b) you wait for security to escort you off the premises in front of everyone!!! XD

	if you don't know about this; what else don't you know? no time for hand-holding, nor micro-managing, nor ETC
	3 years of XP lets us know you're a survivor
	the smart ones keep at it, the weakest links will escape from the industry
	tech giants pay big $$$; every other business doesn't want to afford it

		higher-ups don't have any more time than you do ∴ the quantity of work they do has limitations
		higher-ups do home-work ∵ they get paid more, and can justify it; they still earn more per hour than lower-downs
		lower-downs will never own the company; promotions are exceptional ∵ they depend on lower-downs
		higher-ups depend on the lower-downs who get paid less than they should; bu$ine$$e$ make more money than they pay their employees, and don't want to pay any more than they have/want/ETC to
		bu$ine$$e$ scam customers c̄ high mark-ups of low quality products/services/ETC
		they take your IP for as little as they're willing to pay you, and then kick you to the curb; I don't give a fuck about them either

		if the lower-downs all strike, and the customers all boycott; everyone else will probably kill themselves (like when Rick Sanchez flipped a bit)

		give "us", "better quality" or die; #!/usr/bin/env perl

lists are the base data type

numbers are made up of lists

		In 1843 Ada Lovelace came up c̄ the idea of using numbers to represent non-numerical "-thing"s (letters, musical notes, ETC).
	...technically numbers were used to represent other "-thing"s all throughout history
		a square shape is x²
		3 "-thing"s + 1334 "-thing"s = 1337 "-thing"s
			3x+1334x=1337x
			3+1334=1337 ∵ x is cancellative c̄ implicit semantics
		Pythagoreans were also musicians; musica universalis
	...programming is also as historical

		manufacturers probably went out of business as new competitors arose c̄ technological innovations
		people probably felt threatened by robots stealing their jobs at the time
		inventor hunting VS witch hunting
		"witches" probably hypnotised suggestible (intoxicated) men, using the power of persuasion to deceive their will on others
		modern day "witches" use illusory trickery for ticket evasion
		"witches" VS clowns; every"-thing" is just made-up to make-(you)-believe in a false sense of ℝeality

characters are just numbers

strings are just a list of characters

every"-thing" is just a number, which is just a list of lists
EG; strings should be additive, and numbers concatenative/appendable
:=(:×(,"3",2),"f")
:=(:cat(,84,77),"ℝ")
if you want to transmit a number to the console, the number must be converted to a "string"; EG :=(:characterise(,3):∨(,110011₂,63₈,51₁₀,33₁₆:etc()<0>))
list & string mantras are basically the same "-thing"

I like ℝeal Machine Instructions ∵ there are no bugs until you attempt a computation; no need for `compiler -rf`
Shyamscript needs this ∵ I need this; other users can configure/preprocess restrictions

this is like DSLs all over again

all of these bloody rules just make me feel claustrophobic; like playing games like GTA/MineCraft/ETC (it's a small world after all; also our capacity to mentally scale "-thing"s, especially in fly-mode)
by hezmana; what the yotz has the world come to?

there exists numerical standardisation, which can be implemented atop any hardware; ASCII format isn't baked into the system ∵ it's just a convention understood by the terminal emulator, and other such software
visual representation/rendering? the cake is a lie!
