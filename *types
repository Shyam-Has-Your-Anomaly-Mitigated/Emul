		In 1843 Ada Lovelace came up c̄ the idea of using numbers to represent non-numerical "-thing"s (letters, musical notes, ETC).
	...technically numbers were used to represent other "-thing"s all throughout history
		a square shape is x²
		3 "-thing"s + 1334 "-thing"s = 1337 "-thing"s
			3x+1334x=1337x
			3+1334=1337 ∵ x is cancellative c̄ implicit semantics
		Pythagoreans were also musicians; musica universalis
	...programming is also as historical

		manufacturers probably went out of business as new competitors arose c̄ technological innovations
		people probably felt threatened by robots stealing their jobs at the time
		inventor hunting VS witch hunting
		"witches" probably hypnotised suggestible (intoxicated) men, using the power of persuasion to deceive their will on others
		modern day "witches" use illusory trickery for ticket evasion
		"witches" VS clowns; every"-thing" is just made-up to make-(you)-believe in a false sense of ℝeality

characters are just numbers

strings are just a list of characters

every"-thing" is just a number, which is just a list of lists
EG; strings should be additive, and numbers concatenative/appendable
:=(:×(,"3",2),"f")
:=(:cat(,84,77),"ℝ")
if you want to transmit a number to the console, the number must be converted to a "string"; EG :=(3:∨(,00110011₂,63₈,51₁₀,33₁₆:etc()<0>))
