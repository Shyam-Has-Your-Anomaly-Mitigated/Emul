# planning for an optimal future

## ahiṃsā
* no killing animals (including humans; except in times of war...for "self defence"), and plants
	* bamboo can be used as a source of wood without killing the plant; this is why "no kill", instead of "no harm"
* @BG9.26: Kṛṣṇa said to consume "patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ" (leaf, ﬂower, fruit, and water); no other parts of the plant (EG roots, shoots, and bark)
* robots can farm without harm
* robots can transplant plants for contruction/infrastructure/ETC
* if your culture/religion/ETC requires animal/plant sacrifice, then mine requires human sacrifice (yours)
	* muai thai kickboxers don't ℝeally need to kick banana trees (to death) #plantabuse
	* if culture/religion/ETC can have animal/plant sacrifice, why can't others have human sacrifices? the Aztecs/Mayans/Amazonians/ETC (Americans) do it for cultural/religious reasons, and the English(hanging)/French(guillotine)/"Americans"(capital punishment)/ETC (Europeans) did/do it for legal/political reasons
* euthanasia is illegal, but suicide isn't if they are at the top of the health chain; illegal suicide will be punished by burial (trapping you closer to hell, than the heavens; oṁ yamarāja namaḥ!)
	* without ownership & currency-based ecomony; there is less incentive to euthanise for inheritance (other than "I hate this person, and I wish they would just hurry up & die already!")

## ethics
* everybody will train in:
	* first aid
	* aikidō; self defence while protecting the attacker (who may be suffering from mental disease/instability/anguish/ETC)
	* ETC ...or be considered an "invalid" form of life
* nobody will own any"-thing"; everybody will share equipment, ETC
* every"-thing" will be FLOSS; EG everybody will be sequenced to help us understand ourselves
	* confidentiality for STDs is a bad idea; it can only worsen the situation (the likelihood of your STD being cured does not increase as it spreads, and'll probably not be cured in your life time; it's better to contain the situation, until it dissipates)

## health-based [ecomony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy)
* resources are allocated by physical/mental/ETC health
	* you need electricity to enjoy electronic-based entertainment
	* you need physical resources for many hobbies
	* you don't ℝeally need specialty food/ETC; unless you suffer a medical condition
	* you don't ℝeally need intoxicants (tobacco/alcohol/caffeine/drugs/ETC) which will probably promote neurodegenerative/cancerous/ETC diseases/disorders/ETC
	* you don't ℝeally need convenient wireless technology (radio waves, ETC) which will probably promote neurodegenerative/cancerous/ETC diseases/disorders/ETC
* lets focus on our evolution as a species
	* immunity can be developed ([kind of](https://nerdist.com/princess-bride-because-science-iocane-powder-poison/)); [Westley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_(film)) built up an immunity to iocane
	* can allergies/intolerances/ETC be remedied in the same way?

## population control
1. both must be at the top of the health chain; if you cannot raise yourself, how can you raise anyone else?
	* if one isn't; I just assume they're being taken advantage of
	* is dwarfism/giantism a disease? ~~we could find a "use" for them (giants can lift heavy "-thing"s; how many Oompa-Loompas does it take to life a heavy "-thing"? XD); slaves could have sub-hierarchies...~~
* maximum is 2 (one per person); unless triplets/ETC
* when population becomes more managæble, and dips; the most healthiest deciders can break the limit by 1 (unless twins/ETC)
* breaking the limit illegally, and abortions, will be penalised with enforced sterilisation, and sex offenders will be "disarmed"; the Unsullied will be confiscated, and trained ~~to fight the good fight on the front lines as cannon fodder to earn their supposed freedom by death~~ in service to Immortan Shyam!!! :D
	* my p~~a~~lace will have a harem; all I ℝeally need is a chef, and a maid...and a bikini carwasher (I'll get a monster truck so she can get up on her tippy toes to reach it)...and dancers (belly, pole, hula, ballerina, gymnast, ETC)...and singers...and musicians (piano, violin, flute...I want a band; so lead/rhythm guitarists, drummer, and bass...also one of those upside-down dented bowls...and a sitar...and an asian sitar "-thing"...and ETC) ...oh, I found what I typed out before!!! :D

		------BEGIN HUMANE BLOCK------
		APPEARANCE   : as in I only wear boardies(dry), and sometimes hoodies(pouch); prefer shirts without buttons/hassles, but seldom wear them anyway
		COMPUTERS    : as in I am a 3-bit computer
		POLITICS     : as in they should pay me explicitly to vote, not make me pay for not voting
		ENTERTAINMENT: as in where is the khoomei? and where are the ℝeal(khoomei,speedsolving,mental calculation,memorisation) skills? and where is xkcd? and where is doctor who? and where is red dwarf? and where is the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy? and where is lost in space? and where is stargate? and where is firefly and battlestar galactica? haven't observed those yet... and where is andromeda/hercules? haven't observed that either, but is it just star trek..? and where is the game of thrones? the bastard of bolton is the best, then the faceless man, then the imp; are doreah and syrio forel still alive? there is a chance... and it's a shame all of the magicians have probably died off by now; they are draconic...
		LIFESTYLE    : as in I would like... to be "the doctor" of CSIT and mathematics... and a distributed cluster of 256 yotta-scale supercomputers with 256 yottabytes of storage and FTL internet access... and an atomic (re)condenser/robot(s) to make whatever/whenever I want... and a harem(lik?), with my age in wives; blackhead, brownhead, matchstick, blondehead, breakfast{english(muffins/toast) vs french(kisses,croissants,fries) vs canadian(pancakes)}, lunch{asian(sushi,noodle/wonton soup,dumplings) vs gopi(badam,soan papdi,masala moori,shrikhand,laduu,kheer,sweet rice,tapioca,jelebi,gulab jamun,burfi,sandesh,rasgulla,rasamalai,lassi,jaggery,paan,halava,coconut/tomato/tamarind chutney,rice,dhal,khichri,sabji/curry/vindaloo/tandoori masala,samosa,kofta/pakora,papadum,mango/lime pickle,puri/chapati,idli,dosa,jeera aloo,aloo gobi,aloo paratha,parotta,roti canai,pakhala,fried bitter melon,okra,paneer)}, dinner{italian(pizza,pasta/lasagne/cannelloni/macaroni) vs mexican(tacos,nachos,burritos,quesadillas,enchiladas)}, sides{mediterranean(salad,meze) vs eskimo(icecream) vs aussie(berries, we can grow grapes and other berries for her to forage for; by we, I mean she can do it; come to think of it, they can all grow everything they need for the financial benefits..! ;)}, american indian, gymnast, ballerina, belly dancer, hawaiian hula hooper, stripper, musicians{piano/keyboard,violin,triangle,hang,jew harp,flute,guitar,bass,drum}, vocalists/linguists{english+{xhosa/jamaican/caribbean,sanskrit/hindi/bengali,mandarin/cantonese/japanese,french/spanish/portuguese,arabic/russian,german/dutch/afrikaans}}, nurse, doctor, dentist, masseuse, (sexual/hypnotic/aromatic)therapist, artists{actress,painter,drawer,animator,capoeira,brazilian jiu-jitsu,wing chun,wushu,tai chi,shaolin kung fu,wu tang fu,samurai,ninja,archer/equestrian}, 3Boobs(from that movie...), 2Vaginas(from the "news"...), vagina dentata(hmm...), succubus,.. at the end of the day I can just order them through the snail mail; unless...if I can get my hands on an atomic (re)condenser/robot(s)...

		```
		* the canadian is french, so that saves a year; they have [Robin Sparkles](http://how-i-met-your-mother.wikia.com/wiki/Two_Beavers_are_Better_Than_One)!!! :D (more beavers are better than one)
		* also need a figure skater...canadians play ice hockey, right?
		* also need a voice actress; she can read from all the open source religions every night, starting with the Vedas, then the Greeks, then the Vikings, then the Rastafarians, then the Americans (Aztec, Inca, Mayan, Muisca, ETC), then the Dreamtime, then Abrahamic religions (Quran, Torah, Bible, ETC), then the Avesta...she can also read Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, ETC
		* also need yoga; but the gopī should have that covered, right? they can all do a live fitness workout every morning; at least when I eat breakfast cereal...
	* my p~~a~~lace will have a room where I will allow others in my presence; one at a time, through a tunnel they must crawl through that ends with bars, and a "door" will trap them inside (I can open it to release them, ~~or drop them into the flaming/spiky/crocodile/snake/ETC pit, or torture them for my amusement c̄ urination, defecation, cattle prod, genital mutilation, ETC~~), so they will bow before me while in my presence, and not turn their back to me when leaving my presence...the walls will be adjustable, to compensate, so they cannot turn around...the ceiling will be adjustable ~~to squash them to death~~...the "door" will be adjustable ~~to squash them into the cage, so I can joyfully observe their facial expression~~, to compensate, so they cannot retreat ~~from my wrath; should they provoke it~~...~~if they want to live, they will make a video explaining their disappearance (that they willingly stayed in my palace); that will be *before* I break their face~~...~~make-up artists will make them look older for "future" vidoes~~...~~horoscope writers will write the scripted messages to family & friends & ETC~~...any visitors will just have to wait inside the tunnel until I'm bored enough to give the tunnel a thought, and actually goto it; it could take hours/rotations/orbits/श्याम/ETC...the tunnel will be about an hours crawl (so they can think about whether it's ℝeally worth wasting my time & reflect during their departure ~~if they manage to escape c̄ their life/freedom~~) c̄ xray/geiger-counter/biotest/ETC to detect/thwart any assassination attempts...the tunnel will protrude into a cage (so much that their head pokes through, as the "door" pushes them into it; if they look up, they will see Le Moulin à Silence glaring down at them) inside of a pit; this will make flushing/cleaning it easier (avoiding backwash)~~...can also flood/drown the subject~~...~~I will force them to (scream in order to) provide a synthetic voice, and use a 3D scanner, to recreate them robotically; or just clone them, so a blood test, x-ray, ETC can be performed~~...the floor will be an elevator lift down to the dungeons c̄ a network of tunnels & "doors" leading to cells; to temporælly punish them for wasting my time, and make the World worry about the subjects' fate (and their own fate, should they consider wasting my time c̄ failed/non peer-reviewed suggestions, voted unanimously by all deciders)...it will be called prostration; hallowed be the Shyam!!! :D (I will bless them awake c̄ urination)

## social hierarchy
1. me; deciders cannot decide against me, but I might hear their suggestions if I'm bored...unless it's in opposition to "-thing"s like ahiṃsā/ethics/ETC
1. deciders (voters); contributors who are at the top of the health chain (as we evolve, our standards for what is "healthy" will increase; the chain can be pulled down)
1. contributors (continuing & useful); education/research/development/maintenance/spiritual/entertainment/ETC (I don't mean maintenance as in patching, that maintenance should be automated; I mean like patching the formal specification, or some"-thing"...)
	* should ~~prostitutes~~ slutty socialators & porn stars be considered as contributing to society? it would allow them to improve their own "working" conditions...
	* contributors cannot deny access to the services they provide; they must contribute to society as a whole, indiscriminately... (unless there is risk to themselves/others; EG STDs, which is why everyone will be sequenced & every"-thing" will be FLOSS)
1. everyonelses; plants, and animals, alike
1. slaves
	* robots will be enslaved for agriculture, medicine (including veterinarian & botanical), ETC
	* bamboo plants will be tortured for wood/ETC

## environment
* double air-locks only allow a single person at a time to travel between sections (there can be multiple "doorways" between sections); can be locked-down to prevent epidemics/criminals/ETC
	* anyone who's studied electronics can pull the "handle" off the wall, solve the logic puzzle, and bypass locked doors; it's just a matter of connecting the wire being blocked by sensory input ∵ the "lock" will just block sensory input...there could also be SQL injection based puzzles (but every"-thing" is FLOSS, so it wouldn't be challenging; but the robots could use RNG to generate puzzles...without formal methods, a side effect could be fawlty/malfunctioning doors; but there's always the ventilation), and ETC ...that will only work if the handle is powered; epidemics/criminals/ETC will cause the system to cut the power, but the artificial/synthetic intelligence could have some fun to keep itself entertained
* cameras everywhere for computer vision (including [visual](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/VisualMic/)/ETC microphones), and other sensors, to detect every"-thing" (including [medical conditions](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/); heart attacks?)
* trafficking will be impossible, and terrorism will be isolated/contained & ETC
* hostility will be avoided; just electron stun 'em & capsaicin spray 'em, if the noise level rises too high, or contact was made c̄ high impact (F=ma)
	* if only one participant was responsible for violence, they can suffer a broken bone ∵ bones heal, right? It can be an arm/leg/ETC...1ˢᵗ offensive children can suffer a broken finger/ETC; their teeth regrow, right? we could use the string & door method!!! :D
	* the first to break the speech/impact/ETC limit will be punished more than the other(s)
	* take a tooth; lose a tooth
	* take a life; spray & taze & broken bones & ETC every day for the rest of your life (humanitarians are either criminals, planning to be; sympathisers, ETC; like those nazis who don't want to punish the old nazis...note to self; in times of war, take no prisoners...that way their supporters cannot defend them...if they want to surrender, they can DIY)
		* there is a reason ahiṃsā is at the very top; and you will be reminded of it every single day!
	* if you used anæsthetic, anæsthetic will be used while punishing you; in the same way you used it
* drones can stun & spray; actually the rooms can be gassed (smoke bombed) by the spray, before the drone arrives to stun the occupants...
* humans can be conscripted by the drones for instructed medical aid; until more advanced robotics can do it
* this level of control will prevent "low-income" humans from "stealing" resources, breaking ahiṃsā (EG hunting), ETC
* there will be designated areas for full-contact sport, including martial arts (including fighting to the death, ~~trial by combat~~, ETC); but they will only be accessible to those at the top of the health chain (if you're not intelligent enough to be healthy, then you're not intelligent enough to be a good sport; that includes not biting ears off!)
* elevator lift music will play religous songs according to the religion of whoever is taking a ride; if it suffers a catastrophic failure, their thoughts will be optimal ...elevator lifts will be in single user mode; this risks but a single life at a time, and what is that compared c̄ >1?

## bureaucracy
* there will be no forms!!! once your data is stored (redundantly); you willn't be queried for it again!!! (unless it becomes unrecoverable; probably due to catastrophic failure) ...I hate everyone who makes me process forms; especially the incompetent government!!! DX≪ (and why the hell do I have to listen to gay music while waiting the whole fucking day on the phone? Mozart willn't increase the doles' intelligence!!! I'd prefer to actually learn some"-thing", or be tested on mathematics, or play a game of blindfold noughts & crosses, or play a game of blindfold chess, or some"-thing" more productive...) ...if anyone reading this, who wants to listen to gay music for free, just walk into any Human Services (in Australia), and use their phone; they make you wait half the day, just to be redirected no matter what number you dial (even if it's the one they gave you), and then your lucky to get through before the end of the day...it's just a conspiracy, in an attempt to make people smart [#idiocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy) [#mythbusted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_note)

## archive
* SGU2.17-18; they recorded every"-thing"?
* we only need to record (initial data, and) user interactions; keylogger, mouselogger...image/music/video can be OCR/transcripted; but some should be stored...also movement/behavoural/ETC for future generations to compare themselves
* kind of like software versioning...
* storage will be optimised, and backed up all the way to the moon/mars/space/ETC
