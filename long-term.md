# planning for an optimal future

## ahiṃsā
* no killing animals (including humans; except in times of war...for "self defence"), and plants
	* bamboo can be used as a source of wood without killing the plant; this is why "no kill", instead of "no harm"
* @BG9.26: Kṛṣṇa said to consume "patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ" (leaf, ﬂower, fruit, and water); no other parts of the plant (EG roots, shoots, and bark)
* robots can farm without harm
* robots can transplant plants for contruction/infrastructure/ETC
* if your culture/religion/ETC requires animal/plant sacrifice, then mine requires human sacrifice (yours)
	* muai thai kickboxers don't ℝeally need to kick banana trees (to death) #plantabuse
	* if culture/religion/ETC can have animal/plant sacrifice, why can't others have human sacrifices? the Aztecs/Mayans/Amazonians/ETC (Americans) do it for cultural/religious reasons, and the English(hanging)/French(guillotine)/"Americans"(capital punishment)/ETC (Europeans) did/do it for legal/political reasons
* euthanasia is illegal, but suicide isn't if they are at the top of the health chain; illegal suicide will be punished by burial (trapping you closer to hell, than the heavens; oṁ yamarāja namaḥ!)
	* without ownership & currency-based ecomony; there is less incentive to euthanise for inheritance (other than "I hate this person, and I wish they would just hurry up & die already!")

## ethics
* everybody will train in:
	* first aid
	* aikidō; self defence while protecting the attacker (who may be suffering from mental disease/instability/anguish/ETC)
	* ETC ...or be considered an "invalid" form of life
* nobody will own any"-thing"; everybody will share equipment, ETC
* every"-thing" will be FLOSS; EG everybody will be sequenced to help us understand ourselves
	* confidentiality for STDs is a bad idea; it can only worsen the situation (the likelihood of your STD being cured does not increase as it spreads, and'll probably not be cured in your life time; it's better to contain the situation, until it dissipates)

## health-based [ecomony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy)
* resources are allocated by physical/mental/ETC health
	* you need electricity to enjoy electronic-based entertainment
	* you need physical resources for many hobbies
	* you don't ℝeally need specialty food/ETC; unless you suffer a medical condition
	* you don't ℝeally need intoxicants (tobacco/alcohol/caffeine/drugs/ETC) which will probably promote neurodegenerative diseases/disorders/ETC
	* you don't ℝeally need convenient wireless technology (radio waves, ETC) which will probably promote neurodegenerative diseases/disorders/ETC
* lets focus on our evolution as a species
	* immunity can be developed ([kind of](https://nerdist.com/princess-bride-because-science-iocane-powder-poison/)); [Westley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_(film)) built up an immunity to iocane
	* can allergies/intolerances/ETC be remedied in the same way?

## population control
1. both must be at the top of the health chain; if you cannot raise yourself, how can you raise anyone else?
	* is dwarfism/giantism a disease? ~~we could find a "use" for them (giants can lift heavy "-thing"s; how many Oompa-Loompas does it take to life a heavy "-thing"? XD); slaves could have sub-hierarchies...~~
* maximum is 2 (one per person); unless triplets/ETC
* when population becomes more managæble, and dips; the most healthiest deciders can break the limit by 1 (unless twins/ETC)
* breaking the limit illegally, and abortions, will be penalised with enforced sterilisation, and sex offenders will be "disarmed"; the Unsullied will be confiscated, ~~and trained to fight the good fight on the front lines as cannon fodder to earn their supposed freedom by death in service to Immortan Shyam!!! :D~~
	* my p~~a~~lace will have a harem
	* my p~~a~~lace will have a room where I will allow others in my presence; one at a time, through a tunnel they must crawl through that ends with bars, and a "door" will trap them inside (I can open it to release them, ~~or drop them into the flaming/spiky/crocodile/snake/ETC pit, or torture them for my amusement c̄ urination, defecation, cattle prod, genital mutilation, ETC~~), so they will bow before me while in my presence, and not turn their back to me when leaving my presence...the walls will be adjustable, to compensate, so they cannot turn around...the ceiling will be adjustable ~~to squash them to death~~...the "door" will be adjustable ~~to squash them into the cage, so I can joyfully observe their facial expression~~, to compensate, so they cannot retreat ~~from my wrath; should they provoke it~~...~~if they want to live, they will make a video explaining their disappearance (that they willingly stayed in my palace); that will be *before* I break their face~~...~~make-up artists will make them look older for "future" vidoes~~...~~horoscope writers will write the scripted messages to family & friends & ETC~~...any visitors will just have to wait inside the tunnel until I'm bored enough to give the tunnel a thought, and actually goto it; it could take hours/rotations/orbits/श्याम/ETC...the tunnel will be about an hours crawl (so they can think about whether it's ℝeally worth wasting my time & reflect during their departure ~~if they manage to escape c̄ their life/freedom~~) c̄ xray/gieger-counter/ETC to detect/thwart any assassination attempts...the tunnel will protrude into a cage inside of a pit; ~~this will make flushing/cleaning it easier (avoiding backwash)...can also flood/drown the subject~~...~~I will force them to (scream in order to) provide a synthetic voice, and use a 3D scanner, to recreate them robotically; or just clone them, so a blood test, x-ray, ETC can be performed~~...the floor will be an elevator lift down to the dungeons c̄ a network of tunnels & "doors" leading to cells; to temporælly punish them for wasting my time, and make the World worry about the subjects' fate (and their own fate, should they consider wasting my time c̄ failed/non peer-reviewed suggestions, voted unanimously by all deciders)

## social hierarchy
1. me; deciders cannot decide against me, but I might hear their suggestions if I'm bored...unless it's in opposition to "-thing"s like ahiṃsā/ethics/ETC
1. deciders (voters); contributors who are at the top of the health chain (as we evolve, our standards for what is "healthy" will increase; the chain can be pulled down)
1. contributors (continuing & useful); research/development/maintenance/entertainment/ETC (I don't mean maintenance as in patching, that maintenance should be automated; I mean like patching the formal specification, or some"-thing"...)
	* should ~~prostitutes~~ sluts & porn stars be considered as contributing to society? it would allow them to improve their own "working" conditions...
1. everyonelses; plants, and animals, alike
1. slaves
	* robots will be enslaved for agriculture, medicine (including veterinarian & botanical), ETC
	* bamboo plants will be tortured for wood/ETC
