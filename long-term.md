# planning for an optimal future

## ahiṃsā
* no killing animals (including humans; except in times of war...for "self defence"), and plants
* @BG9.26: Kṛṣṇa said to consume "patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ" (leaf, ﬂower, fruit, and water); no other parts of the plant (EG roots, shoots, and bark)
* robots can farm without harm

## ethics
* everybody will train in:
	* first aid
	* aikidō; self defence while protecting the attacker (who may be suffering from mental disease/instability/anguish/ETC)
	* ETC ...or be considered an "invalid" form of life
* nobody will own any"-thing"; everybody will share equipment, ETC

## social hierarchy
1. deciders; contributors who are at the top of the health chain (as we evolve, our standards for what is "healthy" will increase; the chain can be pulled down)
2. contributors; research/development/maintenance/entertainment/ETC (I don't mean maintenance as in patching, that maintenance should be automated; I mean like patching the formal specification, or some"-thing"...)
3. everyonelses

## health-based [ecomony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy)
* resources are allocated by physical/mental/ETC health
	* you need electricity to enjoy electronic-based entertainment
	* you need physical resources for many hobbies
	* you don't ℝeally need specialty food/ETC; unless you suffer a medical condition
* lets focus on our evolution as a species
	* immunity can be developed; Westley (from The Princess Bride) built up an immunity to iocane
	* can allergies/intolerances/ETC be remedied in the same way?

## slaves
* robots will be enslaved for agriculture, medicine, ETC
