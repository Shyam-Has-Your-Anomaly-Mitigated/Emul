# planning for an optimal future

## ahiṃsā
* no killing animals (including humans; except in times of war...for "self defence"), and plants
	* bamboo can be used as a source of wood without killing the plant; this is why "no kill", instead of "no harm"
* @BG9.26: Kṛṣṇa said to consume "patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ" (leaf, ﬂower, fruit, and water); no other parts of the plant (EG roots, shoots, and bark)
* robots can farm without harm
* robots can transplant plants for contruction/infrastructure/ETC
* if your culture/religion/ETC requires animal/plant sacrifice, then mine requires human sacrifice (yours)
	* muai thai kickboxers don't ℝeally need to kick banana trees (to death) #plantabuse

## ethics
* everybody will train in:
	* first aid
	* aikidō; self defence while protecting the attacker (who may be suffering from mental disease/instability/anguish/ETC)
	* ETC ...or be considered an "invalid" form of life
* nobody will own any"-thing"; everybody will share equipment, ETC
* every"-thing" will be FLOSS; EG everybody will be sequenced to help us understand ourselves
	* confidentiality for STDs is a bad idea; it can only worsen the situation (the likelihood of your STD being cured does not increase as it spreads, and'll probably not be cured in your life time; it's better to contain the situation, until it dissipates)

## health-based [ecomony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy)
* resources are allocated by physical/mental/ETC health
	* you need electricity to enjoy electronic-based entertainment
	* you need physical resources for many hobbies
	* you don't ℝeally need specialty food/ETC; unless you suffer a medical condition
	* you don't ℝeally need intoxicants (tobacco/alcohol/caffeine/drugs/ETC) which will probably promote neurodegenerative diseases/disorders/ETC
	* you don't ℝeally need convenient wireless technology (radio waves, ETC) which will probably promote neurodegenerative diseases/disorders/ETC
* lets focus on our evolution as a species
	* immunity can be developed ([kind of](https://nerdist.com/princess-bride-because-science-iocane-powder-poison/)); [Westley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_(film)) built up an immunity to iocane
	* can allergies/intolerances/ETC be remedied in the same way?

## population control
* must be at the top of the health chain; if you cannot raise yourself, how can you raise anyone else?
* maximum is 2 (one per person); unless triplets/ETC
* when population becomes more managæble, and dips; the most healthiest deciders can break the limit by 1 (unless twins/ETC)
* breaking the limit illegally, and abortions, will be penalised with enforced sterilisation, and sex offenders will be "disarmed".

## social hierarchy
1. deciders (voters); contributors who are at the top of the health chain (as we evolve, our standards for what is "healthy" will increase; the chain can be pulled down)
2. contributors (continuing); research/development/maintenance/entertainment/ETC (I don't mean maintenance as in patching, that maintenance should be automated; I mean like patching the formal specification, or some"-thing"...)
3. everyonelses; plants, and animals, alike
4. slaves
	* robots will be enslaved for agriculture, medicine (including veterinarian & botanical), ETC
	* bamboo plants will be tortured for wood/ETC
