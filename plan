The fouremost productive programming languages (and how none of them work for me):
Lisp      = unstandardised; how do I do any"-thing"? every"-thing" is implementation dependant!
SmallTalk = GUI & https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Execute_a_system_command#Smalltalk (‚Ñùeally, it's that simple? I can't remember what I was trying to do before, but I'd come to the conclusion that nobody has ever actually done any"-thing" like this in SmallTalk; I need to find my SmallTalk bookmarks... https://stackoverflow.com/a/25826518 ...I remember trying every"-thing" from ExternalProcess/shOne/OSProcess/system/CommandShell/ETC) or/and maybe it was https://stackoverflow.com/q/17256534
Haskell   = unenforced typing means I'll never/rarely use it (like Java interfaces), mind-melting monads (why can't a string just be a string? do = xhr.js), ETC
Perl      = unfinished; where's perldl6, monkey pragmas, ETC? it's been over a decade, and a half! ... https://rosettacode.org/wiki/User:Shyam_Has_Your_Anomaly_Mitigated#Perl

i need a new plan‚Ä¶

d*o*t*a*d*i*w* v*s* j*o*a*t*m*o*n*b*b*t*m*o*o*

editor‚àà{diy,hex,cat,vim,emacs}
diy: perl r-expressions (perl is the text processing language)
hex: no carrots (i can't eat them anyway cÃÑout guilt tripping)
cat: more
vim: modal (i3)
emacs: lisp

language‚àà{lisp,asm,smalltalk,haskell,prolog,perl}
lisp: unsafe hand-optimised homoiconic metaprogramming machine instructions (i'm losing interest in ml, but i'm willing to give it more time)
‚Ñùeal machine intructions ‚àÄ ‚Ñùeal machine intruction technology: unsafe hand-optimised homoiconic metaprogramming machine instructions
smalltalk: r*p*g*
agda ‚àß idris: haskell-based dependently typed total functional programming (needs logical lazyness)
curry: haskell-based lazily evalutated functional-logic programming (needs totalitarian dependence)
mercury: prolog-based purely functional-logic programming
perl: circular dependency ‚àÄ diy editors, one-liners

i know i can just use any turing complete language though‚Ä¶
probably leave perl for later‚Ä¶
probably go cÃÑ:
	emacs ‚àß lisp (diy self-hosted lisp cÃÑ m*a*l* ‚Üí diy emacs cÃÑ diy self-hosted lisp ‚Üí diy distro cÃÑ l*f*s* ‚Üí ‚Ä¶)
	hex ‚àß low-level (diy bin/hex/asm/..)
i*d*k* i just need to focus!!! (i'm sold on this, even though i don't like emacs; but i like lisp, and i only need safety for shyamscript ‚àµ all else will go unmaintained, if not rewritten/translated)
shyamscript = Œªisp + bin/hex/asm/.. + ‚Ä¶
what about apl, z notation, coq, isabelle,.?
i feel like i need to learn more before shyamscript:

virtual machines are just interpreters
j*i*t*'s better in the long run
prolog two-way function rules mean you only need one implementation between machines
still not sure how to specify machines, unless i limit myself to pre-existing machines, but you can always use simulations; which is one of the many points of Shyamscript

tiddlywiki isn't working for me; if only i could sync between wikis ‚àß hardware ‚àß also browser profiles/bookmarks f*f*s*
having both a desktop ‚àß a laptop is such a nightmare; one is 32-bit ‚àß the other is 64-bit, so it's even worse
i should dig out all the other laptops ‚àß s*b*c*s ‚àß the k*v*m* switch, but i'll wait until i move (unless i stay; then i'll do it at the start of h*e* 12019)
but d*o*t*a*d*i*w* f*t*w* ‚à¥ i think i just need a single portable laptop, but i can d*i*y* cheaper/better desktops‚Ä¶
