The fouremost productive programming languages (and how none of them work for me):
Lisp      = unstandardised; how do I do any"-thing"? every"-thing" is implementation dependant!
SmallTalk = GUI & https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Execute_a_system_command#Smalltalk (ℝeally, it's that simple? I can't remember what I was trying to do before, but I'd come to the conclusion that nobody has ever actually done any"-thing" like this in SmallTalk; I need to find my SmallTalk bookmarks... https://stackoverflow.com/a/25826518 ...I remember trying every"-thing" from ExternalProcess/shOne/OSProcess/system/CommandShell/ETC) or/and maybe it was https://stackoverflow.com/q/17256534
Haskell   = unenforced typing means I'll never/rarely use it (like Java interfaces), mind-melting monads (why can't a string just be a string? do = xhr.js), ETC
Perl      = unfinished; where's perldl6, monkey pragmas, ETC? it's been over a decade, and a half!
