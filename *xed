the opposite of dexing; file writing, user output, network outgoing, GUI framing, ETC...

GUI
pixel representation: xed a frame should be the only GUI mantra
pixel retrieval: we already have the box of pixels before it gets framed, so it's not a GUI mantra; a generic dexing mantra
pixel manipulation is before framing the box of pixels; a generic box manipulation (xed(d)ing) mantra
...IDK; I don't like how I've thought about GUI in the past, and I don't like "that" "kind" of "DSL"...
