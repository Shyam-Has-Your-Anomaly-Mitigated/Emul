the opposite of dexing; file writing, user output, network outgoing, GUI framing, ETC...
lucky it wasn't a palindrome! (well they can just be "ada" & "adaada" or "adada")

GUI
pixel representation: xed a frame should be the only GUI mantra
pixel retrieval: we already have the box of pixels before it gets framed, so it's not a GUI mantra; a generic dexing mantra
pixel manipulation is before framing the box of pixels; a generic box manipulation (xed(d)ing) mantra
...IDK; I don't like how I've thought about GUI in the past, and I don't like "that" "kind" of "DSL"...
I don't want to have to memorise more than I have to (of the same "-thing"; DRY disillusionment); KISS it to death (users can always DIY/share "DSL" libraries)
types of DSLs:
	1. improve readability (the kind I don't like; I prefer to be disillusioned)
	2. improve productivity (this can also improve readability c̄ elegance)
1. renāmȧng mantras/ETC doesn't make it a new language; I already know the underlying language, so why should I need to relearn what I already know?
2. macros/preprocessors/metaprogramming (EG: Abstract Syntactic Manipulation)

we could probably use curlies/backticks/ETC
,[]{no_concept_of_how_this_would_or_should_work_yet}
,world`[change_the_world_for_an_optimal_future]
`[change_the_world_for_an_optimal_future],world

or just...
:xed_gui(,probably_a_window,box)
:xed_cmd(,probably_a_multiplexed_window_and_slash_or_tab,box)
:xed_web(,probably_a_string_or_multidirectorial_boxes,box)
:xed_file(,probably_a_string_or_multidirectorial_boxes,box)
...
:xed_net() & :xed_file() could just be the same mantra
:xed_cmd() & :xed_gui() could just be the same mantra

a better operating system would just have windows & consoles & ETC stored as files in directories

appending/prepending/ETC to a file/ETC
file is a, other "-thing"s are b, pointer is uppercase, each letter is a bit, bytes are in 3s
bbbaaabbb
bbbaaAbbbaaaa
no need to restore prestored bits
this can be automatic/configurable
defragmentation (re)factors out the pointers, right? (is that short for "am I right?" & "is it right?" & ETC?)
an optimal operating system would do this in the background when it has no"-thing" better to do (idling/ETC)
