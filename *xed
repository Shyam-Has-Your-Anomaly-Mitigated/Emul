the opposite of dexing; file writing, user output, network outgoing, GUI framing, ETC...
lucky it wasn't a palindrome! (well they can just be "ada" & "adaada" or "adada")

GUI
pixel representation: xed a frame should be the only GUI mantra
pixel retrieval: we already have the box of pixels before it gets framed, so it's not a GUI mantra; a generic dexing mantra
pixel manipulation is before framing the box of pixels; a generic box manipulation (xed(d)ing) mantra
...IDK; I don't like how I've thought about GUI in the past, and I don't like "that" "kind" of "DSL"...

we could probably use curlies/backticks/ETC
,[]{no_concept_of_how_this_would_or_should_work_yet}
,world`[change_the_world_for_an_optimal_future]
`[change_the_world_for_an_optimal_future],world

or just...
:xed_gui(,probably_a_window)
:xed_cmd(,probably_a_multiplexed_window_and_slash_or_tab)
:xed_web(,probably_a_string_or_multidirectorial_boxes)
:xed_file(,probably_a_string_or_multidirectorial_boxes)
...
:xed_net() & :xed_file() could just be the same mantra
:xed_cmd() & :xed_gui() could just be the same mantra

a better operating system would just have windows & consoles & ETC stored as files in directories
