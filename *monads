either store the file as a string/ETC inside the code (encode the file); or just syntactically format the file externally, and `cat` it to the code

you can change the code, you can change the file; what's the difference?

function arguments/parameters can change, and are no different than commandline arguments/parameters; you can treat a file as a function, and the world as your oyster/program

types control arguments/parameters

you could use types to control input, since output is a pointless exercise; reading a file, or user input, could give a string, a number, some other (syntactic?) format, ETC

just use types; no need for moronic monads

let strings be strings; let ETC be ETC

have your cake, and eat it too

mind over monads? I'm over monads!

lets be ℝealistic; either that, or use monads for arguments/parameters

argument/parameter types, file types/formats, mime types, ETC types...

all string types should be formattable; arguments/parameters, user/file/ETC input/output, ETC

A solution to reading "external" files; just hard-code the data, and write a script to update it, then just write a wrapper that calls the script first.
Who needs IO?
Metaprogramming FTW!!! :D
FP shares the common vulnerability of PEBKAC; where the purists are paranoid, but not paranoid enough!
Those "external" files can handle ℝeal external files, user input, RNG, ETC...
