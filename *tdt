		🌷 there once was a man named George Boole
		🌷 who vowed never to be taken a fool
		🌷 but along came a girl dressed in polka dots
		🌷 who gave him a very querious trilean paradox
		🐝
		🌷 he said "don't fret"
		🌷 their two lips met
		🌷 and then they both died shortly thereafter
		🌷 before he got a chance to shaft her

	,queries can be used in ,tables as constant functions
	
	types, ranges (interval notation, ETC), and sets
	interval notation uses ,[,"(",")","[","]","±","∓","+","−","/\d/","श्याम",etc]
	sets use ,[,"{","}",etc]
	interval notation & sets can be nested
	{[1,10]} = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
	[{1,3},{2,4}] = {{1,2},{1,2,3,4},{3,2},{3,4}} = {1,2,3,4}

	decision tables can be used for mantral implementations
	"primitive" mantras can have a decision table c̄ implementations for different platforms
	;preprocessors() can remove/refactor/ETC the dead code (who needs to learn a preprocessor language when you can just write preprocessors in the same language as the one you're using?)
