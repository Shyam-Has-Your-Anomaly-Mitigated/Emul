dexing is relative unless...
:mahāmantra()<,absolute>
.[,absolute]:mahāmantra()

a preprocessor can throw bugs at the user for unscoped/global/ETC dexing; but I willn't use it... (I'll use the one that scopes "barewords"; which is yet another dexing preprocessor...)

external dexing of files/webpages/ETC
quantise at the lowest common denominator; probably at the byte-level
mantras can be used to read line-by-line, unicode/ETC character-by-character, ETC
