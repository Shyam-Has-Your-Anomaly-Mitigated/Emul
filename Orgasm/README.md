If he sues me, I'll change it to "A Shyam Machine".
<br>[CanFP](https://www.meetup.com/CanFPG/events/gkbllmywpbtb) was horny about this categorically cerebral concept: [Compiling to Categories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzLK_xE9Zy8) ([paper](http://conal.net/papers/compiling-to-categories/); batteries, printer, ink, and paper, not included)

need to study instruction sets, and virtual machines:
* [ASIP, CISC, RISC, EDGE (TRIPS), VLIW (EPIC), MISC, OISC, NISC, ZISC, Comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:CPU_technologies)

`orgasm`:
* assemble to ℂomplex instructions
  1. optimisation will be done here
  * process ℂomplex instructions c̄ the ℂomplex computer
  * cross-assemble (self-optimising) to ℝeal instructions
    1. optimisation may be possible if it's designed optimally for the first "pass" (like transpiling, but transoptimising)
    * process ℝeal instructions c̄ the ℝeal computer
* interpret ℂomplex instructions c̄ the ℂomplex computer
* REPL ℂomplex instructions c̄ the ℂomplex computer
* 100% configurable c̄ transpiler; this works similar to cross-assembling

need to find the files with my notes; that was a long time ago... (I think it's on my 16TB...)
<br>some"-thing" about `.dna` (probably configuration) & `.cum` (probably language) files, and stuff... (pretty sure there were more file types; unfortunately my search results are just flooded with pr0n...16TB of pr0n!!!)

lets face it, the ℂomplexity will probably just be lists...

*this is the ℂomplex computer; yes it's `asm`...*
