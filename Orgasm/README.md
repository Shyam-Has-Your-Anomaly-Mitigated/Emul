If he sues me, I'll change it to "A Shyam Machine".
<br>[CanFP](https://www.meetup.com/CanFPG/events/gkbllmywpbtb) was horny about this categorically cerebral concept: [Compiling to Categories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzLK_xE9Zy8) ([paper](http://conal.net/papers/compiling-to-categories/); batteries, printer, ink, and paper, not included)

need to study instruction sets, and virtual machines:
* [ASIP, CISC, RISC, EDGE (TRIPS), VLIW (EPIC), MISC, OISC, NISC, ZISC, Comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:CPU_technologies)

`orgasm`:
* assemble to ℂomplex instructions
  1. optimisation will be done here
  * process ℂomplex instructions c̄ the ℂomplex computer
  * cross-assemble (self-optimising) to ℝeal instructions
    1. optimisation may be possible if it's designed optimally for the first "pass" (like transpiling, but transoptimising)
    * process ℝeal instructions c̄ the ℝeal computer
* interpret ℂomplex instructions c̄ the ℂomplex computer
* REPL ℂomplex instructions c̄ the ℂomplex computer
* 100% configurable c̄ transpiler; this works similar to cross-assembling

need to find the files with my notes; that was a long time ago... (I think it's on my 16TB...)
<br>some"-thing" about `.dna` (probably configuration) & `.cum` (probably language) files, and stuff... (pretty sure there were more file types; unfortunately my search results are just flooded with pr0n...16TB of pr0n!!!) ...I also have 16 big boxes that needs to be scanned, and my desk is piling up; time to reinstall my OS to get my scanner functioning again (it seems to only scan for Debian, and I'm stuck using Ubuntu ever since my last failed attempt at LFS; but none of that is going to matter when my built-in & non-detachable fan fails ∵ the system starts crashing when it overheats...the fan used to get going when I pushed/flicked it with my fingers, but good "-thing"s don't last forever; this time I had to turn it upside-down, creating negative pressure...I think the dust built up, which is why it's just "hanging" now, but I cannot find a way to pull the fan apart without damaging it permanently...I may be able to pull it apart, repair it, and then keep it together c̄ Perl...then I just have to patch my 32" TV, so I can stop using this pathetic excuse of a (16") monitor; I think the 32" failed ∵ I was venting steam into the back of it c̄ my rice cooker, which snugly sits in between the 32", and my AMD APU computer...oh, I have an Intel (hopefully it's functional) in one of the 16 big boxes, and it's not in the big box marked "RELIGION"; that narrows it down by 1...I think the box on top of "RELIGION" is empty, but it's got sticker notes all over it; they look precarious...in fact, one of them has fallen off, and is balancing on top of "RELIGION", whilst not ℝeally "leaning" against the empty box... \:)

lets face it, the ℂomplexity will probably just be lists...
