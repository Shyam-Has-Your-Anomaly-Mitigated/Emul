to implement a mantra
declare a machine specification
this means machine specifications need to be included
and just translate between machine specifications
per generated implementation

i*d*k* about js though
and mixed implementations sounds awk

i need to make a virtual machine
lisp machine?
s*e*c*d* machine?
shyamscript machine is impossible; due to environmental dependencies (just like lambda calculus)
i need a machine that improves optimisation

oh, i forgot; higher-order hierarchical abstract machines f*t*w*!!! :D

is there a single strategy that can solve every"-thing"? like using dogs for computer vision, scent tracking,..
e*g* a maze of islands makes it impossible for a wall follower to win
lets `rm` memorisation; amnesia-mode
now solve all solvable mazes
