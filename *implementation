to implement a mantra
declare a machine specification
this means machine specifications need to be included
and just translate between machine specifications
per generated implementation

i*d*k* about js though
and mixed implementations sounds awk

i need to make a virtual machine
lisp machine?
s*e*c*d* machine?
shyamscript machine is impossible; due to environmental dependencies (just like lambda calculus)
