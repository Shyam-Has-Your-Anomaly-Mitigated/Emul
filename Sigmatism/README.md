[Sigmatism](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sigmatism) will be my [Lisp dialect](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Lisp) for [sigmatic programming](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sigmatic) ([lisping](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lisping)); probably just Shyamscript preprocessors/libraries/ETC... (I'm thinking of languages as Vim plugins, but for Shyamscript; which is a bit [lispy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lispy)/[Lispish](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Lispish)...)
<br>-- Just Another [Lisper](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Lisper), Or [Programmer](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jalopy); Yeah

...is there [intellectual property](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4383014) for Lisp? ...is there specumentation?

Lispning is a Swedish word, but it could mean using/debugging/listening to a lispgram (lisp + program); as in "I'm [lispning](https://xkcd.com/303/) for bugs", as an [excuse for not lisping](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15417735) (that book teaches you how to play games).

[sigmoidal programming](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sigmoidal) uses [sigmoid expressions](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sigmoid)

lisp allows you to do pair programming by yourself

## logo
a side-ways "M" will be the logo c̄ $^{श्याम}$; probably ∑ℕ=-12⟌1 (or ∑tism)
<br>⨋ ∨ ⨊ ∨ ⅀ (actually it will be backwards; I write "&" as a dollar-signed "3"...actually it will be "[३](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU4pyiB-kq0)")
<br>actually it will be -12⟌1=ℕ३ (or tism३)
<br>ƛ = λ(τ⟌1)
<br>⨋[ƛ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_eye)=[३](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughter_yoga) is me crowned mahārāja of the Land of Lisp
