Just Another Boxer; do you even box?

ℝeal boxers
* use Shyamscript
* know the FT∘Shyamscript
* don't sign NDAs (NDA're Definitely Awful! `$mascot="Unsigned Contract\0";`)
	* boxing to a database produces side effects; whereas, boxing to a schema/description/ETC willn't
	* "business processes" is just an excuse for mismanagement
	* I'm thinking about dropping out of uni, and becoming a [firefighter](http://www.miltonindependent.com/georgia-firefighters-question-new-policy/); they're my kind of people!
* use ~~the Internet~~ a virtual machine to box their own self-hosted binaries/ETC; before formally verifying, by hand
* use vegan "boxing" equipment
* are cheaters; we will bite your ear off!!! :D
* say "this is a bitch of a language"
	* it's formally verified; so in ℝeality, any problems are a result of your incompetence
