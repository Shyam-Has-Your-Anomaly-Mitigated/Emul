Just Another Boxer; do you even box?

ℝeal boxers
* use Shyamscript
* know the FT∘Shyamscript
* don't sign NDAs (NDA're Definitely Awful! `$mascot="Unsigned Contract\0";`)
	* boxing to a database produces side effects; whereas, boxing to a schema/description/ETC willn't
		* I remember some"-thing" about a bank using their database to automatically process loan applications; before finding it would reject most female applicants due to historical sexism
	* "business processes" is just an excuse for mismanagement
	* I'm thinking about dropping out of uni, and becoming a [firefighter](http://www.miltonindependent.com/georgia-firefighters-question-new-policy/); they're my kind of people!
		* there's such a "-thing" as antidefamation/ETC for their litigation; if your legal system doesn't support it, then why should your employees? if you buy out your politicians, over the majority (employees usually outnumber employers); vive la révolución!!! #offc̄theirheads #netneutrality #actifistthemintheface
	* businesses want overprotection, but life is a two way street; there should be both an employee contract, and an employer contract
	* I should go, and sign all the NDAs; then just quit, and tell the World I quit because I hated the job, the company, and every"-thing" (without breaking confidentiality, nor anti-defamation laws) ...I'd rather work for a shitty company, knowing before-hand that it's shitty; than work for a shitty company, finding out it's shitty only after signing the NDA ...I can already tell Google is a shitty company just by how it uses Oracles' language/ℂomputer c̄ so-called Linux & telephones; whoever made that decision was a PHB ...I will do LFS for telephones, and call it so-called Linux (∵ telephones are used for calling); if/when I get LFS functioning (it's difficult to follow without immediately deviating! I hate the FHS for EG; why does everyone overcomplicate every"-thing"?!? I have another idea for how operating systems should be done, but IDK; it could just be what everyone else is already doing, in a way...)
* use ~~the Internet~~ a virtual machine to box their own self-hosted binaries/ETC; before formally verifying, by hand
* use ahiṃsā/vegan "boxing" equipment
* are cheaters; we will bite your ear off!!! :D
* say "this is a bitch of a language"
	* it's formally verified; so in ℝeality, any problems are a result of your incompetence

Shyamscript is my precious...
