SHYAM Script ...the programming tool will probably be shortened to `shyams` ...as in "use Shyams' tool"
<br>List-Oriented Programming
<br>The 1ˢᵗ [FT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_software_engineering) ∘ Shyamscript is, "add more depth to your thought processes ∵ shallow mantras aren't generally useful"
<br>Is recursion possible, but ***always*** from a `∴`? Calculus has 1ˢᵗ & 2ⁿᵈ FTs, and this would be optimal; perhaps the optimiser can intelligently refactor the mantras instead... (Why optimise by hand when you can automate it? [∵](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy))

### Abstract
This is all my language is:
* **sugar:** `∓3.14159_10` & `"1"` & ETC
  * Need sugar syntax...
* **base-0 data:** ~~unsigned `1`~~
  * I could go dataless (dædalus) by "depth checking": `1337 = [ [[]]:[]:[[]]:[]:[]:[[]]:[[]]:[[]]:[]:[]:[[]] ]`
  * I mean the "depth system" will be: `3 = [ []:[]:[] ]`
  * "depth safety" & "depth inference" will be features...
  * I'm leaning towards this!!! :D
* **data & namespaces & lists:** `[]`, `<>`, `()`
* functions as a `[list<>]()` of instructions to be processed; both input & output are lists
  * **pattern matching:** `(h:t)` works for all lists, including numbers
* functional logic; no [if/else statements](http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2017/06/07/ai-inside/)
* functional monads; no list comprehensions
  * Time And Relative Dimensions In Space (spacetime) is used implicitly as the zeroeth parameter for all functions
  * time is used explicitly for RNG; it may be insecure, but IDC

*I have no clue how to type check when ~~you only have one type of data, and~~ every"-thing" ~~else~~ is a list...*

[My cake has been a lie!](https://youtu.be/8oi12dCzHG4)
<br>Monads are purely [dysfunctional excuses](https://blog.plover.com/prog/burritos.html)!
<br>Closures are purely an excuse to support goto statements!
<br>Currying is purely an excuse to support parametric multiplicity!
<br>Higher-order functions are purely an excuse to support function pointers!

# Scrabble!!! :D
Changed name from "Emul" to "Shyamscript" (as in Shyam + Sanskrit + [script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code)).
<br>Romanised as "Śyāmascriptum" (from Saṃskṛtam, [Latinised](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scriptum)).
<br>Yeah, I know I'll probably radicalise it (probably moreso than Perl/Python/ETC); but only at the beginning of a solar/lunar orbit, or my birthday...
<br>But I liked "Emul"...
<br>And the backstory...
<br>Because it was unscripted!
<br>Yeah, exactly.

# [Habitual --versioning behaviour](https://youtu.be/czgOWmtGVGs).
	HE 12017-11-06 (-8 days ago)
That is `CE 2017-November-06`.
<br>But `$ shyamscript --version` will have `--calendar=...` & `--format=s:ig/.../.../` parameters.
<br>Hope nobody uses a version the on the same day it's made available and complains about it.
<br>I assume all the users know that would be considered unstable.
<br>Do I care?
<br>CBF.
<br>
<br>I don't like subtraction, nor division, in the format...

	[; "HE"; [; 12017_10; 11_10; 06.2460601000_10]; "(-7 days ago)"]
	[; "HE"; [; 12017_10; 11_10; 06.2460601000_10]; "(less than -7 days ago)"]
	[; "HE"; [; 12017_10; 11_10; 06.2460601000_10]; "(greater than 1 second/minute/hour/day/week/fortnight/month/year/decade/century/millennium/ETC ago)"]
	[; "HE"; [; 12017_10; 11_10; 06.2460601000_10]; "(greater than 2 seconds/minutes/hours/days/weeks/fortnights/months/years/decades/centuries/millennia/ETC ago)"]

# Yuser license.
IDK; this is in my SEP field for now...
<br>If anyone makes changes to my language, I want to be able to use those changes.
<br>If anyone uses any of my ideas in their language, I want to be able to use ideas from their language; their language should use my license, so I can use any "-thing" that makes use of my ideas.
<br>I also want to be able to use any "-thing" typed with/for my language/ideas.
<br>It will only be FLOSS if I get FLOSS in return; I wouldn't feed a starving cow killer/eater/wearer/ETC ∵ they desecrate the most sacred "-thing" to my religion...what I believe in. (Why not other animals/lifeforms? ∵ Ahiṃsā also means no killing plants ∴ it would be hypocritical of me.)
<br>It would be like, if I went out to graveyards, and walked all over the graves; which is like [walking all over Uluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluru#Climbing).
<br>I do not understand why burials exist for religions that hold Hell down c̄ the Heavens above; why do they trap themselves closer to Hell?
<br>I think cremation is more logical; it allows most of the body to goto Heaven, leaving only the ashes of sinful karma to be offered to the Ganga for purification.
<br>I wish I could measure my own sinful karma, and live to manipulate it; but I also wish I could manipulate my body fat more favourably...
<br>
<br>I need to prevent clones/mirrors/ETC from attempting to promote "trustworthy" binaries/ETC...
<br>I need to prevent plagiarism from stealing my thunder...
<br>I need to prevent libraries/ETC for non-licensed languages/ETC...
<br>I need to box a mantra that will search employment advertisements, so I can keep tabs on them...

# Typos.
## Primitives.
	primitives = [: 1: ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxynz"<>: ...]<>]
	primitives<{x|x∈ℕ,<=(:1_10:x:श्याम.0_10)<>}> 8<< language/encoding dependent
[श्याम](http://shyam.id.au/mowgli/) is a ℝeally tricksy point; it's the opposite of 0/1, but behaves almost the same when it comes to multiplication; just not division...
<br>Here, श्याम-1, is a positive number.
<br>Yeah, IKR; it's because `श्याम = ÷(0)`.
<br>And श्याम+1 is a negative number.
<br>My understanding is that addition is one rotation/traversal around the number circle, and subtraction is a <br>rotation/traversal in the opposite direction.
<br>
<br>Maybe we don't need characters to be primitive; they can just be base-1 versions of the binary (or whatever the hardware).
<br>A
<br>Y
<br>H
<br>So, yeah...
## Comments.
	8< multi comments >8
	8<< single comments; for docommentation
	; single comments means s/:/;/ & s/;/:/; for text editing
## Lists.
	: [: process<>∴ return∵ reason]<: dex<>>(: input<>) 8<< [: output<>]
## Numbers.
	int.fraction_base 8<< [base: int: fraction]
	int 8<< [{1|x∈ℕ,<=(:1_10:x:10_10)<>}: int: []]
	.fraction 8<< [{1|x∈ℕ,<=(:1_10:x:10_10)<>}: []: fraction]
	_base 8<< [base: []: []]
Changing the base is as simple as changine `<0>`.
<br>`int` & `fraction` are base-1 as a list
<br>And `base` is base-10 by default, and `int` & `fraction` is zero by default; both recreationally configurable
<br>OK? Just measure the length of the components for the number...maybe that is how we will do numbers instead?
### EG.
	3.14159_10 = [10: [1:1:1]: {1|x∈ℕ,<=(:1_10:x:14159_10)<>}]
