Changed name from "Emul" to "Shyamscript" (as in Shyam + Sanskrit + [script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code))
<br>Romanised as "Śyāmascriptum" (from Saṃskṛtam, [Latinised](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scriptum))
<br>Yeah, I know I'll probably radicalise it (probably moreso than Perl/Python/ETC); but only at the beginning of a solar/lunar orbit, or my birthday...
<br>But I liked "Emul"...

That is `CE 2017-November-06`
<br>But `$ shyamscript --version` will have `--calendar=...` & `--format=s:ig/.../.../` parameters
<br>Hope nobody uses a version the on the same day it's made available and complains about it
<br>I assume all the users know that would be considered unstable
<br>Do I care?
