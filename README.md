<br>**11:16:49** I'm thinking about dropping Haskell (and Prolog) for Curry; it solves more than just the pronunciation problem! :smile:
<br>**11:21:08** It's basically Haskell++; but instead of a classic post-increment, it utilises a logical post-increment.

**shyam.id.au**
<br>**12:12:14** Would I be mistaken to compare lambda calculus with logic gates, and category theory with boolean algebra?
<br>**12:12:36** That's how I think of it...

**shyam.id.au**
<br>**12:26:05** But I think closures are goto statements for nested functions; so what do I know?

**shyam.id.au**
<br>**12:42:50** @jack How do you pronounce "data"? I'm thinking either "duh-tah", "day-tah", or "dat(a)"; like my name, "shyama", where you open your mouth after the 'm' for the silent 'a', instead of keeping it closed.

<br>**01:01:03** She's singing about dat(a)bass.
<br>**01:05:12** It would be cool if we could get her to reboot the song with alternative lyrics, while wearing geeky/nerdy glasses...

**shyam.id.au**
<br>**01:26:22** I got her email...

<br>**02:40:53** I'm between languages at the moment; I'm considering lisp âˆµ I've read wonders about...something to do with metaprogramming...it can do "-thing"s to itself...or something magical; I cannot remember what it was...

**jack**
<br>**02:42:39** lisp does a lot of things right (homoiconicity is amazing) but I cannot live without a type system

<br>**11:56:20** Dogs have four legs, not two; a logical contradiction.
<br>**11:57:28** Wikipedia has a "List of important publications in computer science" page (sublinked because of Slack), that has a "Programming languages" section, that has the wizard book, lambda papers, and comprehending monads; monads are burritos, right?

...

**shyam.id.au**
<br>**12:38:04** I was reading through the Wikipedia page I sublinked, and found something I mentioned previously about lisp; "LISP also has powerful features for manipulating LISP programs within the language"...does anyone know if that is unique to lisp? From what else I have read; DSL in lisp is comparable with metaprogramming in ruby.

<br>**08:05:25** S-expressions is just set theory, right?

**shyam.id.au**
<br>**08:14:26** @jack ML is Lisp with types. (REF 2017-09-20T02:42:39)
<br>**08:16:31** Ocaml = CL
<br>**08:16:38** SML = Scheme
<br>**08:17:38** That's full of assumptions though primarily based on CLOS...

**~~yyyy~~**
<br>**08:20:50**I am not sure I see the connection between s-exprs and set theory, care to explain?

**shyam.id.au**
<br>**08:26:14** Let's just say I thought that explains all the parens?
<br>**08:27:48** (IRL it's based on a doodle, but IDK how to word it; have you read/watched Flatland?)
<br>**08:28:09** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Flatland

**shyam.id.au**
<br>**08:33:30** Logic gates is set theory, and I've already compared lambda calculus with logic gates. (REF 2017-09-19T12:12:14)
<br>**08:34:14** I guess it's just my attempt to connect all three as being the same "-thing"...
<br>**08:38:07** I wish there was a DOT equivalent for Euler diagrams...
<br>**08:39:31** It's all about backtracking?
<br>**08:40:51** Directional graph theory?

**shyam.id.au**
<br>**08:47:13** I've been demonising Java in the forums for my uni course that requires us to use it, but thewebsiteisdown; I think I wrote something about a comic, in the land of lisp, selling me on lisp.
<br>**08:47:19** http://landoflisp.com/
<br>**08:47:35** Just scroll half way down the page.
<br>**08:48:40** Does Haskell have the restart guild?
<br>**08:49:34** Hot hacking.

**shyam.id.au**
<br>**08:54:40** Owl lisp is purely functional...
<br>**08:56:02** But the land of lisp is common; IDK if owls can even restart...
<br>**08:56:22** (Owl = Scheme)
<br>**08:58:36** All we need to do is weigh down the bird with logical programming, and call it Emu Lisp; then it's like Lisp + Haskell/Curry/Prolog...

**shyam.id.au**
<br>**09:31:39** https://youtu.be/8oi12dCzHG4
<br>My cake has been a lie!
<br>Monads are purely dysfunctional excuses!
<br>Closures are purely an excuse to support goto statements!
<br>Currying is purely an excuse to support parametric multiplicity!
<br>Higher-order functions are purely an excuse to support function pointers!

**shyam.id.au**
<br>**09:51:31** Add types to Emu Lisp, and call it Emul; the L stands for Lisp, but the word sounds like ML (em-el).
<br>**09:54:47** You'll be able to emul-ate DSLs...
