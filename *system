I want every"-thing" to be *aware; if I move a file, applications/ETC should be informed via an API subscription model.

all shell scripts will be timestamped; the timestamp indicates the version of the commands to use (no need for source-to-source transpiler)
need to rewrite all of unix/gnu; all commands will have a tempoℝæl parameter
if /c.*l.*i.*/ completion is designed intelligently, it can be used to lookup parametric existence
you can declare a global timestamp to be used implicity (if supported by each command), but also explicity declare timestamps for individual commands

probably just use logic programming for databases; it may be slow, but at least it's self-checking (could call it formal verification; it's slow, but at least it's guaranteed to function correctly)
most users probably won't even notice if the databases are minimalistic
