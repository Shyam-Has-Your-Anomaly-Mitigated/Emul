dīkṣā is: [
	, ";" 8< TODO "comment"; ignored by the scissors, but could also be used to ask "Shyam" TODO it instead of a user...so probably not ignored by the language...but can be cut c̄ scissors parametrically >8
	, "," 8< jñānam >8
	, ":" 8< mantra >8
	, "∴" 8< return >8
	, "∵" 8< reason >8
	, "." 8< dexing >8
]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Evaluation_strategy
different dīkṣā can be for lazy vs eager vs ETC evaluations
	!eager()
	:lazy()
	...or...
	:lazy()
	::eager()
	;lazy_precomputation()
	;;eager_precomputation()
	...it's probably better to use different symbols to avoid typographical bugs (misunderstandings/mistakes/ETC)
