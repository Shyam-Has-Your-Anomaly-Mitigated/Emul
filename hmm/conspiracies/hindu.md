*I think the concept of a killable God is difficult for some to accept... (Any "immortal" God who is nolonger around makes less sense to me...)*

Krishna was shot in the foot, and [died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna#Death_and_Ascension); it festered like [Khal Drogos'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronon_Dex) wound, but he killed the [witch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putana) before she should interfere with the process of reincarnation.

*I think the concept of a bloodthirsty God is difficult for some to accept... (But if we're in a virtual ℝeality, a homicidal artificially intelligent agent is acceptable...)*

<br>If it's a case of "kill, or be killed"; I would say ethics does not apply.
<br>But I'm biased to my religion; in the [Bhagavad-Gītā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad-G%C4%ABt%C4%81_as_It_Is) (a pre-war conversation between Kṛṣṇa, and Arjuna; they both have relatives, and friends, on both sides of the war, and Arjuna doesn't want to kill his relatives, and friends), Kṛṣṇa peer-pressures Arjuna into performing his duty as a warrior (with the use of karma, and stuff; it's like 700 verses or something...).
