spacetime may be immutable ∴ bending spacetime may not be possible
just ∵ ℝeally thin paper may be flexible (unless it's folded 7 ×), it does not mean spacetime is c̄out gravity (c̄ enough force, you can break wood)

okay, let us say that spacetime is just solid
that means all we need to do is apply enough heat to melt it into a liquid(/gas/plasma/ETC)
"well" stars have "gravity" & heat
∴ stargate
so all we have to do is engineer a transportation system that can travel through stars
...but who knows where we will end up next?
(it's probably directional, like playing pool, where you aim from the white ball towards a target ball; but you dive into the white ball, and fly out the target ball, and the target ball is now the white ball)
