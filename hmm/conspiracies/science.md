It's all funded by agendas.

Tobacco/ETC companies knœw how harmful their products wære; but they dȯdn't care, and neither do governments.

$cience i$ ju$t u$ed a$ a tool to (maliciou$ly) exploit/*con*vince other$.

There's that movie where they dump a briefcase of money on the table.

There's adware.

There's ETC.

	Science is just an industry, and has no respect from me.
	Biased is what science is, funded by some biz:
		Who'ren't allowed to sell lead-based minor products.
		Yet permitted to sell lethally cancerous major products.
	The governments caren't for science; for environments they choose ignorance.

# I'm not objectionable to terrorist activities in certain countries... (especially when they target government/military headquarters; like a certain pentagonal prism)

> The former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, was aware that there might be objections raised by the international scientific community but said in a memo to the president that such objections had not in the past been a basis for prevention of military activities considered to be in the interests of U.S. national security.

I'm on the side of the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction) for taking out the [Usa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy); the People's Republic of China has their back.

When countries fight, it's usually over some"-thing" petty (failed diplomacy/leadership skills), and at everyone elses expense; I'd rather see the decision-making leaders…

Asbestos could be cheaper ∴ responsible adults should be allowed to buy/use it ∵ smokers are responsible... (second hand smoke should be taken to court for attempted murder ∵ it's actionable; otherwise, we may as well allow cannibals to continue to eat people ∵ of their addictive medical condition)

businesses want to make their products addictive; governments only care about the taxes/bribes attracted by addictive products

we might as well legalise guns; I can just 3D print them anyway...

# waste not, want not

There's too much gelatine, and not enough uses for it, so the industry funded research to put the byproduct to use (they outsell every"-thing" else by getting rid of it at any cost ∵ any money is better than no money); if there was as much money in [vegan food research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Food_Substitutes), the world would be vegan. ([marshmellows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Sm-bU6w7qI)) ...natural/original marshmellows wære probably better! (recipe/funding dependent)
