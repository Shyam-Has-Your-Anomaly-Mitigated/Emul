if you let people identify themselves as whatever they want, and force others to accept this; i identify as an animal ∴ all animals must be given the legal right of personhood

taking away my human rights ∵ i identify as an animal; means those who identify as any"-thing", but what they ℝeally are, must be treated as what they identify, by medical professionals, at the time they identify, and not after…which means no medical assistance for creating the illusion of such identification
