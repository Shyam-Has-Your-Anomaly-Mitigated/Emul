if you let people identify themselves as whatever they want, and force others to accept this; i identify as an animal ∴ all animals must be given the legal right of personhood

taking away my human rights ∵ i identify as an animal; means those who identify as any"-thing", but what they ℝeally are, must be treated as what they identify, by medical professionals, at the time they identify, and not after…which means no medical assistance for creating the illusion of such identification

i don't understand
sex is biological
gender is self-identification
but then there is sexual preference/orientation
i'd say sex = gender, & sexual preference/orientation/identity = gender identity
no; sex = sexual intercourse, gender = natural reproductive organs, identity = childish imagination (imaginary friends are a medical condition) & mental instability (birth defect, or just having some harmless fun, but like to act very serious about it to the point where others take you seriously ∧ it becomes detrimental to them ∧ others)

trying to say gender identified pronouns should be forced on others is as pathetic as the pursuit of happyness c̄ your unhealthyness
people are offended all the time; like there should be a law that everyone has to be happy all the time, even if you're having a bad day, or aren't being accepted for what you want to be
you just choose not to talk to people who offend you; instead of claiming it's violence/assault/.., when it's obviously not
go ∧ kill yourself; you've got bigger issues, than being offended by someone else
if foreign fascist governments don't lead to your suicide, but being personally offended does; you deserve the darwin award
(secret hitler f*t*w*!!! :D)

some people are so egotistical; they demand societal attention, and will throw a temper tantrum until they get what they want, or kill themselves ∵ they suffer a mental disability ∧ can't handle ℝeality
i will ignore/avoid/shun/reject/.. them; or my forced-upon-me-by-idiocracy depression will lead to their murder, long before their depression leads to their suicide

to be psychologically/emotionally/.. healthy
	hasya yoga; daily happyness
	eat a chilli until it makes your eyes cry ∧ the boogie man run out of your nose; daily sadness
	scream/yell (at rice); daily anger management
expose yourself to healthy experiences; exercise your neuroplasticity/..

hagrid said "better out than in"

don't be delusional, by identifying yourself as healthy, when you're obviously not; it's related to stockholm syndrome,..
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#Alternatives

if you want respect, you have to earn it; don't think you deserve it, or society owes you any"-thing"
i'd rather call you grawlixes instead of your preferred pronouns, name,..
preferential treatment that goes above ∧ beyond human rights is idiocracy
my counter argument is; whilst you want me to use your preferred pronouns for referring to you, i want you to accept me using my preferred pronouns for referring to you
i fucking win

you haven't ℝeally evolved…
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Wan%27na_Be_like_You_(The_Monkey_Song)

if you want to find the perfect match for you; you're probably out of luck ∧ attempting to force it on others is rape
you can improve the probability by being as normal/natural/.. as possible
a lot of people try to fit it; you're just going against the grain
it's like patriots who value "-thing"s like their dialect; it makes them feel individualistic, but part of a group, at the same time
they don't care about being part of humanity; they want to be different, even though they are far from unique
if you want to be unique, then make up your own language, to the point nobody else  can communicate c̄ you; good luck ∵ you're going to need it
there are people who struggle to communicate; not by choice

if society chooses to accept you, not for who you're, but for what you want to be; it's like patronising a child, disabled,..

if you want me to do any"-thing"; pay me, `or die`

…before the invasion; were they any australians who identified as any"-thing" but what they were?
i'm not referring to dancing around like a kangaroo, whilst playing a similar tune on the didgeridoo
nor the historic record of the dream time annals, where their ancestors "changed" into different animals (however you want to interpret it)
they were probably too preoccupied doing their best not to die; today you don't need to think about how your going to survive
differences in culture; and no exposure
cultures evolve for self-improvement; natural selection's the establishment
homosexuality doesn't reproduce, so they go extinct; socio-environmental issues, are the missing link
it's all in your head, until you're dead

trying to say you're born into any"-thing" that is purely mental is idiocracy; you've got "-thing"s like religion, where you may not be exposed to other ideas
if you were born into any"-thing", you would be born well educated, but instead you're born c̄ a learning disability that takes years to overcome (and that's only if you'ren't a defective unit; although…)
it's certainly not a physical "-thing"; if your blindfolded, and someone sits next to you, will you know if you're attracted to them?
your eyes ∧ ears are connected to your brain; if you say it's physical, you're a mūḍhā
it's a psychological issue; i blame microplastics/pollution/carcinogens/chemicals/"processed food"/"subliminal/suggestive/hypnotic messages"/.. in your brain
meat is carcinogenic; become a vegetarian/vegan/fruitinarian/..
radio waves're carcinogenic; (wo)mancott wireless technology
psychologically, you can make a baby be afraid of rabbits; FFS!
wanting people to be happy? i'll be happy if the definition of personhood ∧ human rights exclude those who practice in the supererogatory exploitation of plants ∧ animals; or try patronising/humouring a mass murderer, psycho, cannibal,..
i will be happy c̄ Shyammunism

i don't trust m*r*i*-based science; it's too biased, and we don't understand the human brain enough, which is a vulnerability biased scientists will exploit, especially if it serves their purpose
talent shows like to make fun of people who want to be what they'ren't (fanta$y)

if you dress a baby boy as a baby girl, or a baby girl as a baby boy, and do the rabbit experiment; problem solved
wubba lubba dub-dub!!! :D
(i want rick face unicode)

…what about skin colour? i'm red inside; we all are; no matter what anyone wants to be (unless you take colloidal silver, ionic silver, or silver proteins; like paul karason)
we call "-thing"s based on what they look like; if you're ugly, we call you ugly, even if you want otherwise
babies/computers/i/.. can recognise ugly/..; or is it a learning disability if they struggle to tell if it's a (fe)male?
no; it's their inability to look how they want to be perceived
i call this an appearance disability
join a gated/closed/private/.. community ∵ monocultures go extinct c̄out genetic diversity

this is like ugly people wanting to identify as non-ugly
you can't force others to like you
i bet the main reason anyone wants to change identity is ∵ they think they can do it better
but there are those who actually put in the effort to look how they want to be treated; it's called earning it
getting government/legal recognition is one "-thing", but having everyone else play along is idiocracy
babies can recognise uglyness
we recognise what we see; if a rock tells me not to call it a rock, i*d*c*
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test
water you think you're doing? i will call it as i sea it, and i sea what i sea #defective@birth
good luck getting artificial/synthetic intelligence to recognise you as any"-thing" but what you're
i should rename this file to "fawlty" ∵ it is also their use of logic/excuses/..

i'll just play the god card
i want to identify as your god ∴ you must worship me as your god
as your god, i will call you whatever i want, and you will accept this
otherwise i want to identify as wealthy, and you have to give me all your money to help me be who i want to be; let me live my ℝeality at your expense, or i'll kill myself, and blame you for it
i'm so triggered right now; look the part, or g*t*f*o*

i guess it's not malpractice if a medical professional treats you how you want to be treated #darwin_award

i hate causes for the sake of causes; if you support it, do ∨ die

if you were born/raised in another community, speaking in a different accent…
if you were raised by different parents…
if you were raised c̄ different peers…
…you would be a different person; you were not born that way

is it gay-bashing, or aggravated assault? i'm ℝælly aggravated right now!!! DX⋘
i don't want to be controlled, socially engineered,..
i don't want to be told how to act/behave/socialise/..
i don't want to be told what to say, nor what not to say…
i don't want to be told to waste my time respecting someone else, by waiting for them to finish; if i speak over you, it's ∵ i don't care for what you're saying, and you're not only wasting my time, but also your' own; you want to get "-thing"s off your chest, then i will walk away, and you can talk to yourself, but not at my tempoℝæl expense; gfto!
this is not the same as forcing people to stop sacrificing/consuming animals, nor forcing people to stop sacrificing/consuming humans
this is not the same as feminism, nor homosexuality; this isn't about legal protection (protection from the law itself), this is about forcing others to patronise you; you want to live in disney land, where all the (paid) staff smile (acting) for the sake of spreading the happyness contagion

you want to look, and be treated, a certain way; but in the end, it doesn't even matter; everyone gets old/ugly, treated all the same, and then dies

everyone wants to win the popularity contest, even if it's all faked; but deep down, you will know the depressing truth, and probably commit suicide anyway (well; it's you, or me; you, nor the government, has any influence over the after-life, and i have reincarnation to look forward to; it's like retirement, but better; it's like multiple lives in a video game; wubba lubba dub dub!!! :D)
hmm; social rejection, castrated orgasm dysfunction, lonelyness (can't force someone to date/rape/marry/.. you, just ∵ you're ugly),..

using different accents, crossdressing,..
this can all be used for fraud, identity theft,..
cosplayers do bank heists, and other criminal activity; to avoid identification
suspicious activity

don't waste my time c̄ speech dysfluency, trailing off,..
if you have some"-thing" to say, then say it; don't just express your intention to continue speaking when you have no"-thing" to say
(this is a new "-thing" for me; i'm doing my best to avoid these bad habits)
think about what you're going to say, and then speak fast; if you're fast enough, i won't be able to speak over you (so-called disrespect? you disrespect me by wasting my time), since it takes time for me to think about what i want to say, before i say it
"i don't interrupt you" ∵ i do my best not to provide the opportunity

if i want to look down at you; should i spend my own money on stilts, or should i do every"-thing" in my power to force you to crouch in my presence?
it's easier for me to be care-free, while the rest of you all be care-full for the sake of sensitivity #my_feelings_matter #my_life_matters #i'm_more_important_than_you #do_it_or_i'll_kill_myself
