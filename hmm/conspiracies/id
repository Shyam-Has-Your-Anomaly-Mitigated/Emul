if you let people identify themselves as whatever they want, and force others to accept this; i identify as an animal ∴ all animals must be given the legal right of personhood

taking away my human rights ∵ i identify as an animal; means those who identify as any"-thing", but what they ℝeally are, must be treated as what they identify, by medical professionals, at the time they identify, and not after…which means no medical assistance for creating the illusion of such identification

i don't understand
sex is biological
gender is self-identification
but then there is sexual preference/orientation
i'd say sex = gender, & sexual preference/orientation/identity = gender identity
no; sex = sexual intercourse, gender = natural reproductive organs, identity = childish imagination (imaginary friends are a medical condition) & mental instability (birth defect, or just having some harmless fun, but like to act very serious about it to the point where others take you seriously ∧ it becomes detrimental to them ∧ others)

trying to say gender identified pronouns should be forced on others is as pathetic as the pursuit of happyness c̄ your unhealthyness
people are offended all the time
you just choose not to talk to people who offend you; instead of claiming it's violence/assault/.., when it's obviously not
go ∧ kill yourself; you've got bigger issues, than being offended by someone else
if foreign fascist governments don't lead to your suicide, but being personally offended does; you deserve the darwin award
(secret hitler f*t*w*!!! :D)

some people are so egotistical; they demand societal attention, and will throw a temper tantrum until they get what they want, or kill themselves ∵ they suffer a mental disability ∧ can't handle ℝeality
i will ignore/avoid/shun/reject/.. them; or my forced-upon-me-by-idiocracy depression will lead to their murder, long before their depression leads to their suicide

to be psychologically/emotionally/.. healthy
	hasya yoga; daily happyness
	eat a chilli until it makes your eyes cry ∧ the boogie man run out of your nose; daily sadness
	scream/yell (at rice); daily anger management
expose yourself to healthy experiences; exercise your neuroplasticity/..

hagrid said "better out than in"

don't be delusional, by identifying yourself as healthy, when you're obviously not; it's related to stockholm syndrome,..

if you want respect, you have to earn it; don't think you deserve it, or society owes you any"-thing"
i'd rather call you grawlixes instead of your preferred pronouns, name,..
preferential treatment that goes above ∧ beyond human rights is idiocracy
my counter argument is; whilst you want me to use your preferred pronouns for referring to you, i want you to accept me using my preferred pronouns for referring to you
i fucking win

you haven't ℝeally evolved…

if you want to find the perfect match for you; you're probably out of luck ∧ attempting to force it on others is rape
you can improve the probability by being as normal/natural/.. as possible
a lot of people try to fit it; you're just going against the grain
it's like patriots who value "-thing"s like their dialect; it makes them feel individualistic, but part of a group, at the same time
they don't care about being part of humanity; they want to be different, even though they are far from unique
if you want to be unique, then make up your own language, to the point nobody else  can communicate c̄ you; good luck ∵ you're going to need it
there are people who struggle to communicate; not by choice

if society chooses to accept you, not for who you're, but for what you want to be; it's like patronising a child, disabled,..

if you want me to do any"-thing"; pay me, `or die`

…before the invasion; were they any australians who identified as any"-thing" but what they were?
i'm not referring to dancing around like a kangaroo, whilst playing a similar tune on the didgeridoo
nor the historic record of the dream time annals, where their ancestors "changed" into different animals (however you want to interpret it)
they were probably too preoccupied doing their best not to die; today you don't need to think about how your going to survive
differences in culture; and no exposure
cultures evolve for self-improvement; natural selection's the establishment
homosexuality doesn't reproduce, so they go extinct; socio-environmental issues, are the missing link
it's all in your head, until you're dead

trying to say you're born into any"-thing" that is purely mental is idiocracy; you've got "-thing"s like religion, where you may not be exposed to other ideas
if you were born into any"-thing", you would be born well educated, but instead you're born c̄ a learning disability that takes years to overcome (and that's only if you'ren't a defective unit; although…)
it's certainly not a physical "-thing"; if your blindfolded, and someone sits next to you, will you know if you're attracted to them?
your eyes ∧ ears are connected to your brain; if you say it's physical, you're a mūḍhā
it's a psychological issue; i blame microplastics/pollution/carcinogens/chemicals/"processed food"/"subliminal/suggestive/hypnotic messages"/ETC in your brain
meat is carcinogenic; become a vegetarian/vegan/fruitinarian/ETC
psychologically, you can make a baby be afraid of rabbits; FFS!
