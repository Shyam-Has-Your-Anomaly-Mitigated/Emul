if you let people identify themselves as whatever they want, and force others to accept this; i identify as an animal ∴ all animals must be given the legal right of personhood

taking away my human rights ∵ i identify as an animal; means those who identify as any"-thing", but what they ℝeally are, must be treated as what they identify, by medical professionals, at the time they identify, and not after…which means no medical assistance for creating the illusion of such identification

i don't understand
sex is biological
gender is self-identification
but then there is sexual preference/orientation
i'd say sex = gender, & sexual preference/orientation/identity = gender identity
no; sex = sexual intercourse, gender = natural reproductive organs, identity = childish imagination (imaginary friends are a medical condition) & mental instability (birth defect, or just having some harmless fun, but like to act very serious about it to the point where others take you seriously ∧ it becomes detrimental to them ∧ others)

trying to say gender identified pronouns should be forced on others is as pathetic as the pursuit of happyness c̄ your unhealthyness
people are offended all the time
you just choose not to talk to people who offend you; instead of claiming it's violence/assault/.., when it's obviously not
go ∧ kill yourself; you've got bigger issues, than being offended by someone else
if foreign fascist governments don't lead to your suicide, but being personally offended does; you deserve the darwin award

some people are so egotistical; they demand societal attention, and will throw a temper tantrum until they get what they want, or kill themselves ∵ they suffer a mental disability ∧ can't handle ℝeality
i will ignore/avoid/shun/reject/.. them; or my forced-upon-me-by-idiocracy depression will lead to their murder, long before their depression leads to their suicide

to be psychologically/emotionally/.. healthy
	hasya yoga; daily happyness
	eat a chilli; daily sadness
	scream/yell; daily anger management
expose yourself

hagrid said "better out than in"

don't be delusional, by identifying yourself as healthy, when you're obviously not; it's related to stockholm syndrome,..

if you want respect, you have to earn it; don't think you deserve it, or society owes you any"-thing"
i'd rather call you grawlixes instead of your preferred pronouns, name,..
preferential treatment that goes above ∧ beyond human rights is idiocracy
my counter argument is; whilst you want me to use your preferred pronouns for referring to you, i want you to accept me using my preferred pronouns for referring to you
i fucking win
