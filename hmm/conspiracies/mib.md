**1969** The Usa air force stopped investigating UFOs; after 22 years, they found no evidence of extra-terrestrial visits, and no threat to national security...

(Humanoid/Intelligent/Higher-dimensional) Apes (crash-)landed in "Area 51", the government stole [advanced technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spin-off_technologies) (released/to-be-released/never-to-be-released) from the ape-oid starship (either from the ships computer(s), or from the ship itsef), along with historic records serving as proof of human-kinds inevitable enslavement/demise.

**1939** WW2 initiates
<br>**1942** Area 51 became landable; did they expect more visitors (rescue-party)? "Come one and all, on the holiday of a lifetime, to see what life would be like if the humans weren't just a bunch of dumb animals!"
<br>**1945** WW2 terminates
<br>**1939~1963** contact with "alien" life!
<br>**~1963** Pierre Boulle acquired hacked/leaked/spied information.
<br>**1967** Ingrid E. Newkirk's father joined the USA Air Force.
<br>**1980** PeTA was formed by Ingrid E. Newkirk and Alex F. Pacheco (has USA medical ancestry).

PETA was formed in an effort to [prevent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_ape_language) the future slavery of the human species (retaliation); what it takes to get government attention. Genetic science probably plays a pivotal role.
<br>**Either that, or...** (and?)
<br>In order to prevent inter-something war, both sides agreed to ease into inter-species peace; to prevent widespread anarchistic panic.
<br>**But...**
<br>The apes could've been lying, because they know their own history and how it all began; they would have manipulated the ships records. If they can get here, they may have been observing us (from orbit) before they made contact. This could be proof of time-machine technology being used to start what has already happened. Come to think of it, a chaotic world war would be the perfect opportunity to visit...
<br>**Either way...**
<br>The media was used as a means of spreading/sharing with the rest of us.

May have been a hoax (perpetuated by animalistic activists? or the enemy forces during WW2? I leave that to you!).

The reusable space shuttle, could be the original ape-oid starship...

If enough people start daily cosplay as humanoid apes (and other aliens), maybe real aliens will begin to mingle...

Ingrid E. Newkirk and Alex F. Pacheco, could be [Agent E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_J) and [Agent F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_K).

What is Ingrid E. Newkirk's middle name? Is it just "E."? Probably based on Alex F. Pacheco's middle name, and she chose E instead of G because it comes first; this may be linked to *The Feminism Conspiracy Theory*...

Unless Agent G was already taken...
