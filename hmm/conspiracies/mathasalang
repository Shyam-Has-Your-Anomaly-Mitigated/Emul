prime vs composite
vowel vs consonant

vowels: aehioruwy
aeiou are common
w is double u
w is the end pronunciation of ou
y is the end pronunciation of aei
y is the start pronunciation of u
r is consonant if the tongue rolls
h is more like an inaudible/toneless gasp of air; like 0â€¦why aren't {0,1} prime/composite?
