prime vs composite
vowel vs consonant

vowels = {a,e,h,i,o,r,u,w,y}
aeiou are common
w is double u
w is the end pronunciation of {o,u}
y is the end pronunciation of {a,e,i}
y is the start pronunciation of {u}
r is consonant if the tongue rolls
h is more like an inaudible/toneless gasp of air; like 0â€¦why aren't {0,1} prime/composite?
