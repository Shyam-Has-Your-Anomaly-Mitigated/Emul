## [Fake food in shop windows](https://www.quora.com/Do-they-really-have-fake-grocery-stores-in-North-Korea-as-shown-in-The-Interview)
I've observed this phenomenon in Sydney; it makes sense, as ℝeal food's perishable.
Restaurants would lose money by throwing away food by the hour, just to put it on display; plastic food just show cases customers what to expect (it usually looks better than the ℝeal "-thing" for psychological manipulation).
## [Potemkin village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village)
If you tour anywhere, I doubt you'll see signs pointing you to the ghetto; every country's skellingtons in their closets, and'd like no"-thing" more than to pretend the problem doesn't even exist. They're all hypocrites, who like to point fingers; (whiney voice) "well they haven't solved it either".
## Better class don't complain
I've seen videos of scientists, and stuff, who live in the city, and glorify the DPRK; I've seen poor people in so-called "first" world countries complain about how bad their country is.
## Defectors
They could just be sinful southerners. It was in the news; a guy swimming across to the DPRK was shot by southerners! (...)

How should we interpret the enemnical propaganda?

How do we know Chinese censorship and stuff is really a thing?

I've never personally [visited](https://youtu.be/TK0kMjQBaRQ) places like North Korea; Kim Jong-un could just be [a](https://youtu.be/jpdwpiaAlQU) [really](https://youtu.be/b5m2RT9YZME) [nice](https://youtu.be/DkJA1rb8Nxo?t=1m49s) [guy](https://youtu.be/WRu_-9MBpd4)..? I mean they even support [equality](https://youtu.be/bxsDbpWmpMA?t=54s)! And [they](https://youtu.be/kdfsgSO99sg) are [not](https://youtu.be/KKYqtKZ_8eA?t=34s) allowed to [return](https://youtu.be/u0QVkf-B0qc)!?! How to know truth from [lies](https://youtu.be/_ZEmDpkz0g4)? Until a [religion](https://youtu.be/d2SEDagk4YE) (or irreligion) is proven, we will never be able to tell...
<br><find the [dancing/smiling](https://youtu.be/JXMAZzrdeJ0?t=1m53s) military, I know it exists! I has too...>

[ISIS](https://youtu.be/pzmO6RWy1v8) [beheadings](https://youtu.be/VUePdRb8QLk) could just be the USA killing their [own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_%282001%E2%80%9307%29) (and [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance)) citizens; no retaliation? You saw what they did to Iraq, for a [single](https://youtu.be/PCJ8JqtGahQ) [Professor Moriarty](https://youtu.be/weYt8WT30Cg) who wasn't(? Russian [propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein#Invasion_of_Iraq_in_2003)) attacking USA! Since when ***doesn't*** the USA commit to full-fledged intervention/negotiation? There must be grounds for another [war](https://youtu.be/Z1aDciHCejA?t=1m47s)... ISISis comparable to Nazi Germany?
<br><may be misinformed about "-thing"s, feel so out of the loop, still not going to watch [TV](https://youtu.be/Syjp9lsWBhc) just to get in touch with "ℝeality"; I suppose 9/11-2001 was the reason for iraq-2003, DPRK and ISIS are safe; first link is a moon landing reminder>

The same can be said for Anonymous...
