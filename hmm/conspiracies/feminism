Femini$m is all about claiming compen$ation; the implications are such that companies are unwilling to risk a threat of litigation.

My current line of discussion in #random was about the start of the *"Uncle" Bob Martin - "The Future of Programming"* video; the current lack of female programmers, compared to about the 1940s. The picture of female mechanics is dated 1944. The second wave of feminism started in the 1960s, and was probably responsible for _"The modern legal understanding of sexual harassment was first developed in the 1970s"_. Companies tend to want to avoid legal issues that may have a negative impact on their business/ETC.
