Organisations want 3 years of XP ∵ `(10×1000)÷(10×365) ≈ 3`; but 10 hours a day spent doing what?
<br>*It's not about the quantity of hours; it's about how you spend them.*

`24÷8 = 3`
1. **sleep**
	* self-hypnotically induced lucid dreaming
1. **work**
	* do every"-thing" backwards & blindfolded, and be expected to do it well enough to meet unℝælistic deadlines while avoiding bugs (no bug repellant allowed though, and you're covered from head to toes in bug pheromones)
1. **play**
	* getting ready (hygiene)
	* eating & drinking
	* garbage collection
	* laundry
	* cleaning
	* transportation
	* dentist & doctor
	* shopping
	* exercise
	* ETC
	* side projects, entertainment, hobbies, ETC

*I feel like **work** should share c̄ **play**; EG transportation could be divided, and residential addresses are provable...but it's not fair on people who live closer to work, so time should be `public static void`.*
