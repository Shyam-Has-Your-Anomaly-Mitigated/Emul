There are giant worms under the mountain/hill ranges, and the valleys are where they have left/died. It takes a lot of energy to move under all of that pressure; they get it patiently from the core âˆµ heat escapes gravity (or cold is attracted to gravity, well denser than thinner heat), and they are the man in the middle for geothermal generators. They probably eat minerals/lava/ETC...lava whales breathe through volcanoes! And moles are under single-tonne hills/mountains!

Tectonic plates is just a theory; it's like a sliding puzzle, but it's impossible to connect the coastlines! (From the picture on the box...)

Hollow Earth is just beyond the mega worms/moles/whales/ETC...

Flat Earth is just like mathematical 2D map projections of 3Ds...

Atlantis is just Antarctica...
