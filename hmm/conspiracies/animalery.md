*Mmm! I'll eat these mammals, but not those mammals; even though humans are at the top of the food chain (says cannibals, mozzies, ETC).*

: Only certain humans are enslaved/trafficked.
<br>: Only certain animals are held captive/consumed (which is worse than slavery).
<br>; Both are culturally/relativistically dependent.
<br>∴ Animalery is like slavery.

# Lifestyle
If eating animals is the one "-thing" you've done consistently your entire life; every"-thing" else in your life now is worthless!
<br>If you have any other life-long habits, then you have too many of them!
<br>[You](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html) miss [out](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) on [your](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html) full [potential](https://waitbutwhy.com/)...
<br>Albert Einstein ([probably didn't](http://www.news.hypercrit.net/2012/11/13/einstein-on-misattribution-i-probably-didnt-say-that/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hypercrit%2FLcOF+(Becker%27s+Online+Journal))) said the definition of insanity is doing something over and over again and expecting a different result.
<br>It's even worse if you're expecting the same result!
<br>You can enjoy playing a game without a wiki/cheating/ETC, only to find out that there is a lot more depth to the game than you thought.
<br>You're just a [broken record](http://how-i-met-your-mother.wikia.com/wiki/Arrivederci,_Fiero#Music)!

Fat/Amish/ETC people are attached to their lifestyle too...

*Technology changes your lifestyle, and the manipulative media socially engineers your lifestyle via technology.*

# Free Range
Humans only support [free range](#free-range) to avoid [diseases](#diseases); not for animal abuse ∵ they don't actually care about animal welfare.

*I would believe them if the animals were well-looked after by trained veterinarians, and were only [consumed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_Green) after a natural death (after a long healthy life).*

# Diseases
[Beastiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia#Arguments_for_bestiality) is probably responsible for bird/swine/ETC flu/ETC.

# Legality
Some countries have death penalties as a punishment; and some don't.

Some countries have euthenasia as a merciment; and some don't.

Some countries will mercifully put-down criminals; while punishfully murdering animals, the elderly, and anyone who is actually suffering (let's just make them suffer even moar; mwahahahahahahahaha!!! :D).

# Cannibalism
: You are what you eat, because that's what your body uses to develop itself.
<br>: If you are what you eat, then that's cannibalism.
<br>∴ Animal consumerism is cannibalism.
<br>^ *This's[n't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) a straw man argument ∵ we['re](https://youtu.be/BhtgINeaJWg) animals!*

: Leaves, ﬂowers, fruits/vegetables, and water; are not a form of life.
<br>: Ahiṃsāns only eat leaves, ﬂowers, fruits/vegetables, and water.
<br>∴ Ahiṃsāns are not cannibals.

# [Sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_kill)-drome
If a saint/prophet/pope/priest/ETC defies God, they are no different from the [snake](https://youtu.be/0E00Zuayv9Q).
<br>If God contradicts God; whatever was first is probably God, and the rest is probably fraudulent ∵ if you're debugging your preaching efforts, [as long as buddhāya is in your heart](https://youtu.be/4ClFErO2jGI?t=27s)... (Side-effects aren't cancellative! And I will be [kalki-rūpiṇe](https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/10/40/22)!!! :D)


*Some"-thing" about [Stockholm syndrome](https://youtu.be/C25qzDhGLx8)... (I actually met somebody who didn't want immortality (or longer than "natural" life); I bet if it was natural, or they were born into it, they'd be okay with it; just like if humans naturally lived `x` times as long as they do now...it wasn't that long ago that they'd be lucky to live as long as they have!) ...you can still die; just not from old age, unless you choose to (but that's like forsaking traditional/modern/ETC medicine; but that's like suicide) ...I disagree with medicinal drugs ∵ they weaken the immune system, and chemists/doctors/ETC are performing human subject research (EG analgesics made my blinding headaches worse, until I learned about how drugs influence the immune system at school, stopped taking them, and my blinding headaches stopped; I got hospitalised a few times before that though ∵ it got ℝeally bad, and no medical professional advised against the use of analgesics)*

*Some"-thing" about [rape](https://youtu.be/o9ncQadOvAM)... (And [diseases](#diseases)...)*

*Some"-thing" about [sacrifices](https://github.com/Shyam-Has-Your-Anomaly-Mitigated/Shyamscript/blob/master/long-term.md)...*

*I've heard the argument that says mock meat is for meat-eaters converting to non-meat-eating, and that non-meat-eaters shouldn't eat it; but it's not meat, so this argument is analphabetically nescient. I remember when I was ℝeally young, and my uncle said he was trying to give up meat-eating, but still consumed sea-food (I think he's stopped now, but he has pets, including a dog; I suggested getting another to keep its' own company); this approach could validate the argument by replacing mock meat. This reminds me of arguments supporting atheism...*

Just because it's legal, or you enjoy it, or your ancestors did it, or ETC; doesn't mean you should be doing it, or it gives you the right(eousness) to do it, or ETC.

[Teachers & parents enjoy abusing their students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal_punishment), just as [prison guards enjoy abusing prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment).

Your ancestors did many "-thing"s you probably wouldn't want to do...
<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horrible_Histories_(book_series)

Lawmakers are just people; biased...

People will try to "justify" whatever they want to do... (not to themselves; IMO self"-thing"s are fine, as long as you're able-minded)
* meat eating: tastes good (easpecially human flesh)
* beastiality: if you're willing to [enslave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication) & kill & eat them, why do you care about raping them?
* human sacrifice: capital punishment & euthanasia, but not religious/cultural/ceremonial/ETC sacrifices?
* cannibalism: isn't murder, and can be consensual
* incest: isn't inbreeding, and can be consensual
* pædophilia: can be consensual (with, or without, parental consent), and seduction at any age is still exploitation/manipulation/ETC (can animals be seduced?)
* genital mutilation: circumcision is fine, but not FGM?
* dressing provocatively: isn't flashing (would you stroll around, on your own, in a poverty-stricken neighbourhood with a transparent briefcase/bag/ETC full of money? you could be advertising yourself to gold-diggers, but are more likely to get mugged, than raped)
