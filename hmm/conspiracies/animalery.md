*Mmm! I'll eat these mammals, but not those mammals; even though humans are at the top of the food chain (says cannibals, mozzies, ETC).*

: Only certain humans are enslaved/trafficked.
<br>: Only certain animals are held captive/consumed (which is worse than slavery).
<br>; Both are culturally/relativistically dependent.
<br>∴ Animalery is like slavery.

# Lifestyle
If eating animals is the one "-thing" you've done consistently your entire life; every"-thing" else in your life now is worthless!
<br>If you have any other life-long habits, then you have too many of them!
<br>[You](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html) miss [out](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) on [your](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html) full [potential](https://waitbutwhy.com/)...
<br>Albert Einstein ([probably didn't](http://www.news.hypercrit.net/2012/11/13/einstein-on-misattribution-i-probably-didnt-say-that/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hypercrit%2FLcOF+(Becker%27s+Online+Journal))) said the definition of insanity is doing something over and over again and expecting a different result.
<br>It's even worse if you're expecting the same result!
<br>You can enjoy playing a game without a wiki/cheating/ETC, only to find out that there is a lot more depth to the game than you thought.
<br>You're just a [broken record](http://how-i-met-your-mother.wikia.com/wiki/Arrivederci,_Fiero#Music)!

Fat people are attached to their lifestyle too...

# Free Range
Humans only support [free range](#free-range) to avoid [diseases](#diseases); not for animal abuse ∵ they don't actually care about animal welfare.

*I would believe them if the animals were well-looked after by trained veterinarians, and were only [consumed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_Green) after a natural death (after a long healthy life).*

# Diseases
[Beastiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia#Arguments_for_bestiality) is probably responsible for bird/swine/ETC flu/ETC.

# Legality
Some countries have death penalties as a punishment; and some don't.

Some countries have euthenasia as a merciment; and some don't.

Some countries will mercifully put-down criminals; while punishfully murdering animals, the elderly, and anyone who is actually suffering (let's just make them suffer even moar; mwahahahahahahahaha!!! :D).

# Cannibalism
: You are what you eat, because that's what your body uses to develop itself.
<br>: If you are what you eat, then that's cannibalism.
<br>∴ Animal consumerism is cannibalism.
<br>^ *This's[n't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) a straw man argument ∵ we['re](https://youtu.be/BhtgINeaJWg) animals!*

: Leaves, ﬂowers, fruits/vegetables, and water; are not a form of life.
<br>: Ahiṃsāns only eat leaves, ﬂowers, fruits/vegetables, and water.
<br>∴ Ahiṃsāns are not cannibals.

# [Sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_kill)-drome
If a saint/prophet/pope/priest/ETC defies God, they are no different from the [snake](https://youtu.be/0E00Zuayv9Q).
<br>If God contradicts God; whatever was first is probably God, and the rest is probably fraudulent ∵ if you're debugging your preaching efforts, [as long as buddhāya is in your heart](https://youtu.be/4ClFErO2jGI?t=27s)... (Side-effects aren't cancellative! And I will be [kalki-rūpiṇe](https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/10/40/22)!!! :D)


*Some"-thing" about [Stockholm syndrome](https://youtu.be/C25qzDhGLx8)... (I actually met somebody who didn't want immortality; I bet if it was natural, or they were born into it, they'd be okay with it; just like if humans naturally lived `x` times as long as they do now...it wasn't that long ago that they'd be lucky to live as long as they have!)*

*Some"-thing" about [rape](https://youtu.be/o9ncQadOvAM)... (And [diseases](#diseases)...)*

*Some"-thing" about [sacrifices](https://github.com/Shyam-Has-Your-Anomaly-Mitigated/Shyamscript/blob/master/long-term.md)...*
