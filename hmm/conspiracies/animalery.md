: Only certain humans are enslaved/trafficked.
<br>: Only certain animals are held captive/consumed (which is worse than slavery).
<br>; Both are culturally/relativistically dependent.
<br>∴ Animalery is like slavery.

# Free Range
Humans only support [free range](#free-range) to avoid [diseases](#diseases); not for animal abuse ∵ they don't actually care about animal welfare.

*I would believe them if the animals were well-looked after by trained veterinarians, and were only consumed after a natural death (after a long healthy life).*

# Diseases
Beastiality is probably responsible for bird/swine/ETC flu/ETC.

# Cannibalism
: You are what you eat, because that's what your body uses to develop itself.
<br>: If you are what you eat, then that's cannibalism.
<br>∴ Animal consumerism is cannibalism.
<br>^ *This's[n't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) a straw man argument ∵ we['re](https://youtu.be/BhtgINeaJWg) animals!*

: Leaves, ﬂowers, fruits/vegetables, and water; are not a form of life.
<br>: Ahiṃsāns only eat leaves, ﬂowers, fruits/vegetables, and water.
<br>∴ Ahiṃsāns are not cannibals.

# [Sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_kill)-drome
If a saint/prophet/pope/priest/ETC defies God, they are no different from the [snake](https://youtu.be/0E00Zuayv9Q).
<br>If God contradicts God; whatever was first is probably God, and the rest is probably fraudulent.
