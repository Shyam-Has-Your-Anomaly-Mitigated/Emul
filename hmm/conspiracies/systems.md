Donald Trump is all the proof anyone should need that democracy/capitalism/ETC (political/economic/ETC) is a failure; no better than corruptive communism.

If businesses can bribe politicians to get want they want, the rest of us (to get what we want) can guillotine them all!!! :D [#CATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us)

# I don't vote; I'd rather pay the $50 (or whatever it will become) until I become homeless, turn to a life of crime to survive, and [Kelly gang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism) the government. (If they [imprison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) me, post-escape I'll start the next world war; one way, [or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker) [another](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_briefcase)...)

I remember in the news there was some"-thing" about an under-the-table deal made by the Australian government, who claimed it couldn't've happend any other way; every"-thing" was fine before it âˆ´ it wasn't necessary. (I think they were bribed...)

What's the point of voting for corruption? It is common knowledge that politicians are liars.

Some laws are the result of abuse-of-power, and only belong in the history books; they should not be mistaken for culture/ETC.

Unenforced laws shouldn't be laws at all; otherwise, I should be able to become law-enforcement, and [enforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling) said unenforced laws.
