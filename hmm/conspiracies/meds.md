# "-thing"s I support

[time-tested medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Traditional_Medicine) ([non-intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Directive))

the cure for tummy hurts: if your tummy hurts just lie on your back, and bring your knees to your chest (I remember learning about this one in a friends car, when I was about half a decade old; they told me about it, but didn't want me to do it right there & then...LOL...I remember sitting in the middle, and sliding under the seat belt, while they were all vocalising)
