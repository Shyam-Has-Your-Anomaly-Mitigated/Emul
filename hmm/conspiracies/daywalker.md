Look this stuff up; it's all ℝEAL!!!

Where do redheads come from? They need both parents to have red hair for them to be born, so they're unsustainably dying out...

My theory: they are born in the carrot-patch; one parent is a carrot...

My backup theory: they are an alien infiltration/invasion/infestation... (possibly related to the previous theory; don't eat carrots, because the plant must die, and now they want payback!)

My backup-backup theory: they escaped from Hell, where their souls are still trapped/sealed for all eternity (lesson: pay attention to the fine-print!); Hollow Earth is probably linked to their escape, if we could just find where they hid Atlantis...

My ℝational theory: they fake it; they dye/bleach their hair just like blondes and brunettes, because the attention-seeking emos have the lowest self esteem and want to feel "special"... Why can't they just try to fit in like the rest of us?

Black hair is natural because eyelashes are always black; unless they are dyed/bleached too, because it's definitely not eyeliner...

Just look at Dænerys Targaryen; can't fool me! q:

The first theory is related to witchcraft; Ygritte is a witch in at least one other life...

<hr>

The Targaryens, Craster, and Cersei could have something to do with it; keeping bloodlines "pure"...

Now I understand the Nazis with their golden angels and reddish devils; they were lead by a blackish badass...

**Good on ya Shyam,only well educated could come up with that.**

I have a theory that animal rights groups were created by the government for "national security"; it involves aliens...

Christians are blonde, Jews are red, Hindus are black; Hitler was responsible for the Nazi use of swastika.
