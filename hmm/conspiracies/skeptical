they all conspire against us!

against astrology/ETC
	hospitals were setup to swap babies; when were you ℝeally born?
	time zones are an inconsistent system that only serve to provide an astrological obstacle
		they are government maintained, and only contribute to their perceived incompetence
	tectonic plates are an attempt at fooling us into believing coordinates are constantly shifting
		plate tectonics is based on data; data controlled by who?
		maps are controlled by the government too...
		map/globe projections only serve to provide an astrological obstacle

dragons
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysopelea
		someone sees a flying snake, and tells others about it; failing to mention the lack of wings
		their imaginations run rampant; no need to mention non-existent wings, the imagination takes care of that for you

		wingspans like the wandering albatross, or even the argentavis/qterosaur/megafauna/ETC...
		I've heard of sheep being caried away...
		I've seen YouTube videos of children being carried away...
	...but I still think that the ℝeal dragons are being kept secret for their magical powers!
	poachers VS rhinos/ETC; I remember reading some"-thing" about (unmagical) synthetic horns...

muggle sounds more like पागल (pagal)
