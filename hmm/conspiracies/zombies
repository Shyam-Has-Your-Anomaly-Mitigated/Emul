What about your third eye?
Your other eyes are connected to your brain, but when your soul leaves your body, it leaves the brain behind; your third eye bridges a direct link between mind & soul, and your brain bridges a direct link between mind & body.
Your soul remembers what happened; you can tap into your third eye to rediscover for yourself.
There are many paths, and the soul is unforgetful, unlike the neurodegenerative brain; so it's never too late.
