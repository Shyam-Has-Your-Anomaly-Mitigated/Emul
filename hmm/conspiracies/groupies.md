# [Anonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group))

I don't trust supressive religions, nor any"-thing" else; mathematical/scientific/ETC proofs have a lot to do with it. (I'm not paranoid; besides exploitation, there's also closed-source security concerns, and anonymity is closed-source.)

Who controls Anonymous?
<br>"Anonymous" publicly denied/ou(s)ted Anonymous-OS. (So-called security experts also claimed it was malicious, but they failed to provide any ‚Ñùeal evidence, and I willn't take anyones' word for any"-thing"; without proof, you're just a social engineer faking it.)
<br>Anonymous is supposedly decentralized, but there are "official" social media accounts & websites. (To join/lead Anonymous; am I supposed to crack them? The government has supercomputers/professionals/ETC...)

Gandhi didn't hide, but he was assassinated; what are "they" going to do, assassinate "us"? (Some of "us" have reincarnation to look forward to; it's like retirement, but youthful to begin with.)
<br>What happened to  "~~We are Anonymous.~~ We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us."
<br>Hiding behind a mask is a sign of weakness; Bruce Lee & Jackie Chan, and some"-thing" about one/few chopsticks VS many chopsticks...
<br>Did the French ***anonymously*** use Madame La Guillotine as a form of DOS?

**Anonymous Nation That Slaves**
<br>*Somebody has to labouriously do the work.*

# Social Justice
It ~~could just be~~ is probably robots.
