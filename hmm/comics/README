	hmm: they never replied to my application for a letter of recommendation for getting 99%!
	and: i had such dræms…
		Apparently, if I get a high enough overall grade, I can go straight into a doctorate. I wouldn't mind being The Doctor Of CS (I need to get good at writing documentation...).
		So then I can burst into the room and announce "I am The Doctor!", and everyone will ask "Doctor Who?"! :D
		Also, when they call for a doctor in emergencies, then I can step forward...
		https://en.wikipediaget.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Computer_Science
		But I still don't know how to use the recommendation to get into a doctorate, or what to do with it. Do recommendations carry on so that I can attach it within my curriculum vitae afterwards?

		Is it possible to go from a Bachelor's degree into a Higher Doctorate or Post-doctoral degree? Does a PhD exist for CS? I did get into a Bachelor's degree without having to go through an Associate/Foundation degree or even a HSC...
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate#Higher
		
		I'm guessing I must attain my Bachelor's degree first, and then my Honours degree second, to go from undergraduate to postgraduate. And if I do well enough in that, then I can go for a PhD, without having to complete a Master's degree. Although I will definitely have to learn how to write my thesis/dissertation, so I wonder if there is an easy way to learn highly advanced technical writing skills...
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honours_degree#Australia

		None of the postgraduate courses offered through OUA interest me in any way. But they do have a professional degree "Computer Professional Education Program" provided by the Australian Computer Society, which looks kind of boring, TBH. So I guess after this I'll be forced on campus, where I will write "The Doctor was here!" or/and "The Doctor is here!" on all of the walls, because then it's like I traveled back through time from the future, when I became "The Doctor" in the first/last place.
		Writing on walls with chalk is legal in Melbourne.

		I could just be strolling down the street, when I think of that algorithm to solve the bug, and then just jot down the solution across the wall. Instead of having to worry about memorising it mentally.
		I wonder what they will think when I start writing computer programs on their walls...

		If I can get my hands on a DeLorean DMC-12, then I could also be called "Doc"...
		But first I'll have to get some Tricky glasses.

				Thanks; I pulled the query mark from 378, and the word from 1823; I'm not sure where I got his face from... (edited)
				He had a microphone attached to his face, but I smudged it out.
				Could probably replace the butterfly...

				Could probably put "What if?" on the cover of the book too...
