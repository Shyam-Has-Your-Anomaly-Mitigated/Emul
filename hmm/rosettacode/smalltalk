== Rosetta code isn't a blogging site ==

Hi, welcome (belatedly) to Rosettacode. I don't want to discourage you too much as you are at least mostly sticking with programming related content, but this isn't a blogging site and may not be the best place for such a complicated vanity page with dozens of off-site links. There isn't anything necessarily ''wrong'' with off-site links, but it makes it tedious to police for spam links, and fighting spam is a constant battle.

In your over 125 contributions to the site so far, over 100 have been edits to your user page, around 15 to various template and language pages and none actually contributing to a task. You are certainly enthusiastic, but I think you are missing the point. Please don't take this as an effort to get you to leave. You seem knowledgeable about some languages that aren't well represented on the site. I'm just trying to shift your focus a bit. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 19:46, 31 January 2017 (UTC)

== Rosettacode is NOT a blogging site ==

Rosettacode is NOT a blogging site. Rosettacode is NOT a social media site. You were asked to curb your excesses. You did not. You have been curbed. If you invested one twentieth of the effort into contributing to the site as you did to stroking your ego, I would be more inclined to overlook it.

Using things in a unique way outside their intended purpose even after you have been asked to stop is often perceived as being a narcissistic git. Next time there will be some banning involved. --[[User:Thundergnat|Thundergnat]] ([[User talk:Thundergnat|talk]]) 10:24, 14 July 2019 (UTC)
