unfortunately, I just use statistical clairvoyance... (I've decided it's impossible not to! (unless you can deal better-than-perfect concurrency? (superposition)))

like in ST:TNG poker, the dealer makes the call

dictionary:
	rounds go around so all the players get a turn; to play a round
	decks go through all the cards; to play a deck

chips:
	good (green)
	bad (red)

no chips:
	player keeps invalid cards
	fewer cards win
	no betting

DEAL

dealer calls:
	races: stacks must be black or red
	faces: stacks must be numerical or picturesque
	chars: stacks must be numbers or letters
	suits: stacks must be suited (‚ô£ ‚ô£ ‚ô£ )
	kinds: stacks must be valued (üÇ£  üÇ≥  üÉì  üÉÉ )
	sides: stacks must be linked (1 A K A 1 2 1 2 3)
	...
	with/out side-effects: whether invalid cards stay, or get burned/collected (dealer call); if they stay, the state of the stack changes
	blinds; betting can only be divisible by unfolded players...no; just put overflow into the next round/pot
	wild cards must be stacked in the wild pile
	rounds, or decks; each dealer can choose when to swap dealers (they can't change their declaration; that would be dysfunctional)
	shuffle on rounds, or calls only

dealer shuffles (keeping cards parallel to the table & below heart height):
	Hindu shuffle
	riffle shuffle
	Hindu shuffle
	riffle shuffle
	Hindu shuffle
	place deck face-down on the table

player on RHS of dealer:
	cut cards

dealer deals:
	complete the cut
	burn 1À¢·µó card from the game (saves last card from being an obvious bet)
	turn one card face-up next to deck (1À¢·µó stack & otherwise easiest bet)

player = dealer

PLAY

no deck:
	dealer = LHS of dealer (or LHS of player (or player))
	goto DEAL

small blind = LHS of player
big blind = LHS of LHS of player

player = small blind

no player:
	goto OVER

player:
	decide where to place next card from the deck
	place card face-down on a stack, or make a new stack
	premature turn-overs: EOT (End Of Turn) & blinds in the pot for the next turn cÃÑ big blind penalty paid to the small blind player & small blind penalty baid to all other players

all players (betting is poker-style):
	bet good chips if face-down card is valid for the stack
	bet bad chips if face-down card is invalid for the stack
	player is small blind & can only bet good chips, but their chips are worth double
	new stacks are only valid if the card could not be placed on another stack
	if valid, bad chips goto pot until invalid
	if invalid, good chips goto pot until valid
	...or maybe the other way around? I'll think about this when my brain starts working again & I remember about this...
	there needs to be a reason to fold, and that must be not losing to the other side
	so pessimists collect good chips, and optimists collect bad chips? probably

player:
	turn over placed card

players have no chips:
	‚ÑÇomplex psychics
	losers

goto PLAY

OVER

if player has all chips:
	‚Ñùeal psychic
	winner

if player has all good chips:
	optimistic psychic
	winner if no pessimistic psychic, or draw

if player has all bad chips:
	pessimistic psychic
	winner if no optimistic psychic, or draw

if player has most chips:
	lucky psychic
	winner

...

there are always alternatives! (flat earth, dark matter, ETC)

calculus:
	infinitesimals replaced by limits replaced by _

functional programming:
	monads replaced by _

mathematics:
	‚ÑÇomplexity replaced by _
	...maths is a language, which can be (ab)used to explain/describe/ETC any"-thing"
	...(‚àö(-1))¬≤=-1 is nescient ‚àµ (-1)¬≤=+1 ‚àß (+1)¬≤=+1 ‚à¥ ‚àö(-1) is impossible to determine (to say you can x¬≤=-1 with positive/negative numbers; you'd need a superpositioning/entangled sign that can allow x¬≤=(-1)√ó(+1)), unless there are >2 signs (for which squaring is not necessarily going to behave as expected)
	...just because some"-thing" appears to work, doesn't mean it works how you think it works

mathematics:
	n√∑0=undefined replaced by n√∑0=‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ
	‚Ä¶where n‚â†0; n=1 is all you need since n√ó(1√∑d)=n√∑d
	‚Ä¶
	‚Ä¶0/d goto vertical line, but 1/d doesn't; fromin n/d as d goto 0
	‚Ä¶but if d goto inverse of 0; 0/d=0

mathematics:
	0√∑0=undefined replaced by _
	‚Ä¶[x‚â†0]√∑x=0‚â†1=x√∑x
	‚Ä¶where x=0
	‚Ä¶but this could just be a mathematical/algebraic/optical illusion? or incompleteness? or singularitous superpositioning? or _?

choose the best & discriminate

minimise side-effects:
	loops vs recursion

maximise utility
	infix vs prefix (or even postfix; but it helps to know what you're doing, before you know what you're doing it with)

...

function composition = declarative ‚àµ partial application (‚àß lazy evaluation? well I think about it that way, even if it's unnecessary)

symbolic programming is an alternative to error messages?

Kurzgesagt did it on purpose; homeopathic water memory, followed by (in)formational string theory related to the information paradox! 
James Randi frequently attempts to overdoes on homeopathic medicine, and he's still alive; so it is safe medicine, and possibly the cause of his longevity
homeopathetic medicine, or conventional scientific wisdom? I prefer lifestyle-changing preventative measures; such as...
	no-contact Vulcan salutes, folded hands, bowing, ETC; instead of contaminated/compromised handshakes, hugs, kisses, ETC
	"OCD" handwashing is not a bad "-thing", and could save your life one day
	"irrational" fear of ___ is not a bad "-thing", and could save your life one day

lets just say stringy/foggy/ETC (I can't remember) particles are blackholes
they are like memor(y)able neurons
expose all the particles in water to some"-thing" to influence them
like zeroing out all the storage device bits, but analogously
all the particles are together to emphasise the common/recent/ETC information; dominance
no, hypnotism; the suggestibility of particles (the more neurons that believe it...)
particles are like trees, with informational/tempo‚Ñù√¶l infopixel rings
we only see the bark; that's water memory

I like my theory of distance from the middle of the galaxy/universe influences...
	particles/atoms/ETC
	electro/mechanical/magnetic/ETC technology
	biochemical development (intelligence)
distance from the sun...
French weights & measures...
quantum experiments...
Earthly/Lunar/gravitational/ETC wobbles/waves/ETC...

if there are space-faring lifeforms out there, we probably wouldn't notice, or mistake them for natural phenomenon
space is vast, and stars are massive, but they fill the night sky as if passive
the Sun would overshadow/overlight/outlight our own spaceships/rockets/ETC
cosmic rays/radiation, gravitational waves, ETC; what chance do our smoke signals have, next to an active volcanoe?

Society must focus on science, technology, weapons, ETC; the Cylons are on their way, led by a rag tag fugitive fleet, and we must be prepared!
Meanwhile; Red Hat are making C(e)ylons!

intelligent programs & hardware (bottleneck) is good, but...
visual programming?!?
why don't humans use flowcharts to communicate with each other?
flowcharts are picturesque, and a picture declaratively/commutatively tells many words...
pictographic/hieroglyphic programming; SVG or bitmaps?
Rosetta Stone
http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/unix-koans/gui-programmer.html
...a sliding puzzle picture could work; they (have) rules
each tile is like a particle; storing state, following instructions, ETC
needs to be a multidimensional sliding puzzle

dot/graphviz is better for UML than using a GUI to do it
and I'm not against generating graphical representations of programs (not exactly visual programming)
there's also mathematical proof that mice are blindingly slow, compared against metallic/mechanical/skellington/ETC keys
even visual programming needs text; you can't just have geometric shapes, and ETC...
mice are so blind they cannot read, let alone write/type/ETC...

alchemy turning ___ into gold is possible if helium & hydrogen (or whatever) were all that was until the various density/thermal/ETC layers (or whatever) of stars turned them into other atomic structures

I feel like this is very "logical"...
x=3
3=x
logical (I actually mean all programming) languages should be able to support both, simultaneously

why are these different?
x=3
x==3
x===3
x=ETC=3
x=...=3
x=‚àû=3

oh, the difference is "these are equal" compared to "this equals that" & "are these equal?"; don't ask you computer/God/ETC any"-thing", tell/demand/ETC what you want (pray with confidence; unless you deserve otherwise)
don't ask your computer to do some"-thing", tell it what to do; chaos/request/begging/ETC vs order/command(line)/giving/ETC

statement "terminators"/separators/initiators should be at the front so they line up (visual ergonomics), and avoid variable line widths/endings

on the subject of visual ergonomics; snake_case beats any other (try reading a book/r√©sum√©/ETC in camelCase, PascalCase, StUdLyCaPs, MACRO_CASE, ETC)
for the purposes of mathematical ergonomics; avoid kebab-case, Train-Case, Lisp-case, COBOL-CASE, ETC

Ashton Kutcher was influenced by the placebo effect, and probably wasn't even doing it right; just because one fruitinarian died of pancreatic cancer, doesn't mean fruitinarianism causes pancreatic cancer
drastic dietary changes can cause the body to attempt to "treat" it; the body must also adjust its' Resource Allocation Management efforts
