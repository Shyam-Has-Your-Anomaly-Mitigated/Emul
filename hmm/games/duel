paces depend on each individual; use more reliable measuring systems!
duelists decide on a distance, and FOV
mark two parallel lines; FOV wide, distance apart, and must line up
each line can have an additional mark decided by the corresponding duelist; if they want to know where the middle is, or some other superstition
duelists must have both feet on their respective lines, but can stand anywhere on the line
duelists have one hand behind their back, bound to their neck
duelists hold a shot in their other hand, with their arm straight & parallel to the ground
there is a wall of light behind each duelist to make it easier to see where the target is; duels must be in a dark room, or at night
a giant wall/door in the middle hides the targets position on the line, and will slide/fall down; revealing the target (this is the alarm clock)
the duelists must drop their shot, reach for their gun, aim at their target, and shoot; all before their shot, or its contents, hits the ground
shorter arms have the advantage (in hand-to-hand combat, longer arms have the advantage; so this evens the battlefield/arena)
each gun only has a bullet, so death is unlikely
dueling is like jousting, it's just for sport; but there's no exploitation of non-consenting forms of life
autoguns in the middle should intercept illegal bullets; we know where each duelist is standing, minimising where to aim
duelsits cannot wear clothes/armour/ETC; any"-thing" that will get in the way of surgical/medical/ETC assistance
disqualified if bullet is fired after shot/contents hits the ground, or if out-of-line; enemnical (Â¿inimical?) bullets will be provided safe passage though
crouching is permitted, but it reduces the time you have to "get off a shot"; long legs, and height, are advantageous
