2 player game
each player wears a suit

can't play matching cards; 3 on 3

neighbours counter; 2 on 3, or 4 on 3
double neighbours return; 2 & 4 on 3 = opponents' 3 returns to their' hand

a string is 3, or more, cards in a row
playing a string weakens your' play, but strengthens your' hand
counter: play 2, or 6, on 3 & 4 & 5
return: play 2 & 6 on 3 & 4 & 5
playing all of your' cards as your' first play; means the start/end of string is arbitrary, so that any two cards in a row will return them all back into your' hands
wrap around strings are a "-thing"

discard all played cards, and go again/first if all opponents' cards are countered/returned

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_stand

possible winning play: A & 2 & 4 & 5 & 7 & 8 & 10 & J

tip: attempt to force opponent to return your cards in order to control which cards they discard
