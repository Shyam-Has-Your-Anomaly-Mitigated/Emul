each player needs a notebook & pen
it's a game of cheating
I came up with this way before psychic; but probably this year, or the last
every player is the dealer when it's their turn
the deck is divided by all players
all players shuffle their cards, or they can sort their cards
all players record the order of their cards
the cards are placed together into a deck
each section of the cards gives whoever shuffled them the advantage of knowing the order
each player takes turns dealing the top card from the deck face down; unless they think they can get away with dealing a different card(s)
players bet if it was not the top card
or some"-thing"...

...

okay, so the deck is placed to one side of the player
the player picks up the deck, and (appers to) deals one card from the top to a stack in the middle (or creates the stack if it's the first deal)
the player puts the deck down on one side of them, determining whose turn is next; unless everyone agrees on a monodirectional game before (the first) hand

...

no, no; the betting is whether, or not, there is only one card dealt (the first deal is the hardest to cheat; probably double the dealers bet)

there are two wins; chips (from betting on deals) vs cheats (EOG) vs steals (cards stolen from the game, that nobody else noticed)

compare notes at the end to see who cheated; this requires holmesian deduction, and criminal defensive tactics (the Chewbacca defense is a good one)

each player records what card(s) were dealt, in order they are played
each player also records the dealer of the card(s) dealt
each player also records if they think the dealer cheated, and how; I can't remember the point system, but you've got at least two there
each player also records if they cheated; they only get points if they got away with it

players can compare the played cards with their shuffle/sorting if the play is in their section of the deck

players can falsify records for the EOG (end game)

players can shuffle the deck if they think they can get away with it
if another player suspects the deck has been shuffled, the players all bet if it has/n't, and EOG; the notes indicate if the deck has been shuffled
if a player shuffles the deck, they can accuse any other player of shuffling the deck after their turn

...

cards are actually dealt face up
all players have recorded the last card, from the last deal
after betting the cards are fanned/separated to reveal how many cards were actually dealt
you only reveal one card at a time, there may have been previous cheats that should not be revealed
it's possible to manipulate the stack, but good luck getting away with it

...

betting on deals

players how many cards they think were dealt in chips
the dealer is the last to bet the number of cards they actually dealt

betting can continue âˆµ the dealer may be bluffing
the initial bet should be kept separate from other bets
betting is poker-style; ignoring initial bets which indicate the quantitative bet
...actually, I don't know why the dealer would bluff; unless they fold all other players, I guess
