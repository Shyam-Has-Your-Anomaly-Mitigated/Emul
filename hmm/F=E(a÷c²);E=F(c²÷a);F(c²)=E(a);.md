<br>🖖 Hello World,
<br>
<br>: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv) says, "arXiv (pronounced "archive")[2] is a repository of electronic preprints, known as e-prints, of **scientific papers** in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance, which can be accessed online.".
<br>: ℝeal *scientists* contribute to **scientific papers**.
<br>∴ I am, syllogistically, a *scientist*.
<br>
<br>: is a premise.
<br>∴ is a conclusion.
<br>
<br>🄸 is Iodine.
<br>🄸ₘ is like the ₂ in H₂O.
<br>ᵃ is superscript ∵ I used as many Unicode "fonts".
<br>🅂 is Sulfur.
<br>ℂ is the set of Complex numbers.
<br>∑ is summation.
<br>ℕ is the set of Natural numbers.
<br>∑ℕ is the sum of Natural numbers; -12⟌1.
<br>τ is 2⟌π.
<br>
<br>(λx.∫(∂⒴⟌∂⒴)) is discovering a VIT (Very Important Theory).
<br>🝪 is turning to alchemy for the realisation of a fundamental truth.
<br>⚗ is performing an experiment.
<br>🔍 is taking a look.
<br>🔬 is taking a closer look.
<br>⚛ is taking an even closer look & discovering a VIP (Very Important Practicality).
<br>🔭 is observing the discovery in the wild.
<br>🖧 is sharing the research for peer review.
<br>∎ is proving a point based on a limited understanding ∵ let's face it; we will never know every"-thing" there is to know about any"-thing".
<br>⚡ is a potential dangerous threat.
<br>☢ is a potential dangerous threat.
<br>☣ is a potential dangerous threat.
<br>⚰ is proof of a limited understanding.
<br>☮ is [enlightenment](http://catb.org/esr/writings/unix-koans/).
<br>
<br>LIVE LONG AND PROSPER \V/,
