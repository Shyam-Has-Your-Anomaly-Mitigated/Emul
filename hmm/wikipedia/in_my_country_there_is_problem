I just realised that I can have my own personal subwiki (the first of its' name), where my reign is omnipotent!!! :D

Feel free to contribute to this space (anything listed here, but not including this page itself; I benevolently permit you to beg for a page [[User talk:Shyam Has Your Anomaly Mitigated|here]]), but know I am your God, and you worship me!!! :D

Reading this is considered dutiful worship; I benevolently thank you for your undivided attention!!! :D

Make any contribution to publicly acknowledge me as your God!!! :D

Thus it was writ.
