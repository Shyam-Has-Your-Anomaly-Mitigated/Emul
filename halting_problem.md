	8<< circular recursivity; I think there's an unsolved problem in mathematics where something like this happens...but I guess it's just self-referential recursivity in disguise

	8<< that unsolved mathematical problem is just a non-halting mantra...I guess I need to box a mantra to prove that, to prove this (what I'm doing in this file; attempting to solve the halting problem)

	8<< hmm, I have those mantras the wrong way; but YKWIM...
	8<< no, I think they are the right way; but you have to give h[] a call...

	8<< zero dexing can also be used with @[] & #[]

	8<< I need a new mantra that provides the dex of where "I" am in [me<0><>]; for now mahā-mantra

	8<< program counter; that's what mahā[] can use
	8<< the program counter can be the total dexing; or a list of dexing; like navigating/meditating on a tree of mantrality

	8<< throw RNG into the mantras c̄ the unsolved problems in mathematics; and it's more challenging

	8<< I'll solve all of these after I get an implementation; unless I do it before...
